<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P> This is a book about cops, and  wild teenage whiz-kids, and
lawyers, and hairy-eyed anarchists, and industrial technicians, and hippies,
and high-tech millionaires, and game hobbyists, and computer security
experts, and Secret Service agents, and grifters, and thieves. This book is
about the electronic frontier of the 1990s. It concerns activities that take
place inside computers and over telephone lines.
<P>	A science fiction writer coined the useful term "cyberspace" in
1982.  But the territory in question, the electronic frontier, is about a
hundred and thirty years old. Cyberspace is the "place" where a telephone
conversation appears to occur.  Not inside your actual phone, the plastic
device on your desk.  Not inside the other person's phone, in some other
city.  <I>The place between</I> the phones.  The indefinite place <I>out there</I>,
where the two of you, two human beings, actually meet and communicate.
<P>	Although it is not exactly  "real," "cyberspace" is a genuine place.
Things happen there that have very  genuine consequences.  This "place" is
not "real," but it is serious, it is earnest.  Tens of thousands of people have
dedicated their lives to it, to the public service of public communication by
wire and electronics.
<P>	People have worked on this "frontier" for generations now.  Some
people became rich and famous from their efforts there.  Some just played
in it, as hobbyists.  Others soberly pondered it, and wrote about it, and
regulated it, and negotiated over it in international forums, and sued one
another about it, in gigantic, epic court battles that lasted for years.  And
almost since the beginning, some people have committed crimes in this
place.
<P>	But in the past twenty years, this electrical "space," which was
once thin and dark and one-dimensional -- little more than a narrow
speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone -- has flung itself open like
a gigantic jack-inthe- box.  Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the
glowing computer screen.   This dark electric netherworld has become a
vast flowering electronic landscape.   Since the 1960s, the world of the
telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though
there is still no substance to cyberspace,  nothing you can handle, it has a
strange kind of physicality now.   It makes good sense today to talk of
cyberspace  as a place all its own.
<P>	Because people live in it now.   Not just a few people, not just a
few technicians and eccentrics, but thousands of people, quite normal
people.  And not just for a little while, either, but for hours straight, over
weeks, and  months, and years.   Cyberspace today is a "Net," a "Matrix,"
international in scope and growing swiftly and steadily. It's growing in
size, and wealth, and  political importance.
<P>	People are making entire careers in modern cyberspace.   Scientists
and technicians, of course; they've been there for twenty years now.  But
increasingly, cyberspace is filling with journalists and doctors and lawyers
and artists and clerks.   Civil servants make their careers there now, "on-
line" in vast government databanks; and so do spies, industrial, political,
and just plain snoops; and so do police, at least a few of them.  And there
are children living there now.
<P>	People have met there and been married there. There are entire
living communities in cyberspace today; chattering, gossipping, planning,
conferring and scheming,  leaving one another voice-mail and electronic
mail, giving one another big weightless chunks of valuable data,  both
legitimate and illegitimate.  They busily pass one another computer
software and the occasional festering computer virus.
<P>	We do not really understand how to live in cyberspace yet.  We are
feeling our way into it, blundering about.   That is not surprising.  Our
lives in the physical world, the "real" world, are also far from perfect,
despite a lot more practice.   Human lives, real lives,  are imperfect by
their nature, and there are human beings in cyberspace.  The way we live
in cyberspace is a funhouse mirror of the way we live in the real world.
We take both our advantages and our troubles with us.
<P>	This book is about trouble in cyberspace. Specifically, this book is
about certain strange events in the year 1990, an unprecedented and
startling year for the the growing world of computerized communications.
<P>	In 1990 there came a nationwide crackdown on illicit computer
hackers, with arrests, criminal charges,  one dramatic show-trial, several
guilty pleas,  and huge confiscations of data and equipment all over the
USA.
<P>	The Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was larger, better organized, more
deliberate, and more resolute than any previous effort in the brave new
world of computer crime. The U.S.  Secret Service, private telephone
security, and state and local law enforcement groups across the country all
joined forces in a determined attempt to break the back of America's
electronic underground.   It was a fascinating effort, with very mixed
results.
<P>	The Hacker Crackdown had another unprecedented effect; it
spurred the creation, within "the computer community," of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a new and very odd interest group, fiercely  dedicated
to the establishment and preservation of electronic civil liberties. The
crackdown, remarkable in itself, has created a melee of debate over
electronic crime, punishment, freedom of  the press,  and issues of search
and seizure.   Politics has entered cyberspace.   Where people go, politics
follow. This is the story of the people of cyberspace.
