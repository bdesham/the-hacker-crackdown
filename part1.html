PART ONE: Crashing the System
</HEAD> </TITLE>
<BODY>
On January 15, 1990, AT&T's long-distance 
telephone switching system crashed. 
<P>	This was a strange, dire, huge event.  Sixty thousand people lost 
their telephone service completely.   During the nine long hours of frantic 
effort that it took to restore service, some seventy million telephone calls 
went uncompleted. 
<P>	Losses of service, known as "outages" in the telco trade, are a 
known and accepted hazard of the telephone business.    Hurricanes hit, 
and phone cables get snapped by the thousands.   Earthquakes wrench 
through buried fiber-optic lines.  Switching stations catch fire and burn to 
the ground.  These things do happen.  There are contingency plans for 
them, and decades of experience in dealing with them.   But the Crash of 
January 15 was unprecedented.  It was unbelievably huge, and it occurred 
for no apparent physical reason. 
<P>	The crash started  on a Monday afternoon in a single switching-
station in Manhattan.  But, unlike any merely physical damage,  it spread 
and spread.   Station after  station across America collapsed in a chain 
reaction, until fully half of AT&T's  network had gone haywire and the 
remaining half was hard-put to handle the overflow. 
<P>	Within nine hours, AT&T software engineers more or less 
understood what had caused the crash.  Replicating the problem exactly, 
poring over software line by line, took them a couple of weeks.   But 
because it was hard to  understand technically, the full truth of the matter 
and its implications were not widely and thoroughly aired and explained.  
The root cause of the crash remained obscure, surrounded by rumor and 
fear. The crash was a grave corporate embarrassment. The "culprit" was a 
bug in AT&T's own software -- not the sort of admission the 
telecommunications giant wanted to make, especially in the face of 
increasing competition. Still, the truth <I>was</I>  told, in the baffling 
technical terms necessary to explain it. 
<P>	Somehow  the explanation failed to persuade American law 
enforcement officials and even telephone corporate security personnel.   
These people were not technical experts or software wizards, and they had 
their own suspicions about the cause of this disaster. 
<P>	The police and telco security  had important sources of information 
denied to mere software engineers.   They had informants in the computer 
underground and  years of experience in dealing with high-tech rascality 
that seemed to grow ever more sophisticated.   For years they had been 
expecting a direct and savage attack against the American national 
telephone system.  And with the Crash  of January 15 -- the first month of 
a new, high-tech decade -- their predictions, fears, and suspicions seemed 
at last to have  entered the real world.   A world where the telephone 
system had not merely crashed, but, quite likely, <I>been</I> crashed -- by 
"hackers." 
<P>	The  crash created a large dark cloud of suspicion that would color  
certain people's assumptions and actions for months.  The fact that it took 
place in the realm of software was suspicious on its face.   The fact that it 
occurred on Martin Luther King Day, still the most politically touchy of 
American holidays, made it more suspicious yet. 
<P>	The  Crash of January 15  gave the Hacker Crackdown its sense of 
edge and  its sweaty urgency.   It made people, powerful people in 
positions of public  authority, willing to believe the worst.  And, most 
fatally, it helped to give investigators a willingness to take extreme 
measures and the determination to preserve almost total secrecy. An 
obscure software fault in an aging switching system in New York  was to 
lead to a chain reaction of legal and constitutional trouble all across the 
country. 
<P>	Like the crash in the telephone system, this chain reaction was 
ready and waiting to happen.  During the 1980s, the American legal 
system was extensively patched to deal with the novel issues of computer 
crime.  There was, for instance, the Electronic  Communications Privacy 
Act of 1986  (eloquently described as "a stinking mess" by a prominent 
law enforcement official).   And there was the draconian Computer Fraud 
and Abuse Act of 1986, passed unanimously by the United States Senate, 
which later would reveal a large number of flaws.   Extensive, wellmeant 
efforts had been made to keep the legal system up to date.  But in the day-
to-day grind of the real world, even the most elegant software tends to 
crumble and suddenly reveal its hidden bugs. 
<P>	Like the advancing telephone system, the American legal system 
was certainly not ruined by its temporary crash; but for those caught under 
the weight of the collapsing system, life became a series of blackouts and 
anomalies. 
<P>	In order to understand why these weird events  occurred, both in 
the world of technology and in the world of law, it's not enough to 
understand the merely technical problems.  We will get to those; but first 
and foremost, we must try to understand the telephone, and the business of 
telephones, and the community of human beings that telephones have 
created. 
<P>	Technologies have life cycles, like cities do, like institutions do, 
like laws and governments do. 
<P>	The first stage of  any technology is  the Question Mark, often 
known as the "Golden Vaporware" stage.   At this early point, the 
technology is only a phantom, a mere gleam in the inventor's eye.   One 
such inventor was a speech teacher and electrical tinkerer named 
Alexander Graham Bell.


<P>	Bell's early inventions, while ingenious, failed to move the world.   
In 1863, the teenage Bell and his brother Melville made an artificial 
talking mechanism out of wood, rubber, gutta-percha, and tin.  This weird 
device had a rubber-covered "tongue" made of movable wooden segments, 
with vibrating rubber "vocal cords," and rubber  "lips" and "cheeks."  
While Melville puffed a bellows into a tin tube, imitating the lungs,  young 
Alec  Bell would manipulate the "lips," "teeth," and "tongue," causing the 
thing to emit high-pitched falsetto gibberish. 
<P>	Another would-be technical breakthrough was the Bell 
"phonautograph" of 1874, actually made out of a human cadaver's ear.  
Clamped into place on a tripod, this grisly gadget drew sound-wave 
images on smoked glass through a thin straw glued to its vibrating 
earbones. 
<P>	By 1875, Bell had learned to produce audible sounds - ugly shrieks 
and squawks -- by using magnets, diaphragms, and electrical current. Most 
"Golden Vaporware" technologies go nowhere. 
<P>	But the second stage of technology is the Rising Star, or, the 
"Goofy Prototype," stage.   The telephone, Bell's most ambitious gadget 
yet,  reached this stage on March 10, 1876.  On that great day, Alexander 
Graham Bell became the first person to transmit intelligible human speech 
electrically.   As it happened, young Professor Bell, industriously tinkering 
in his Boston lab,  had spattered his trousers with acid.   His assistant, Mr. 
Watson, heard his cry for help -- over Bell's experimental audiotelegraph.  
This was an event without precedent. 
<P>	Technologies in their "Goofy Prototype" stage rarely work very 
well.  They're experimental, and therefore halfbaked and rather frazzled.  
The prototype may be attractive and novel, and it does look as if it ought 
to be good for something-or-other.  But nobody, including the inventor, is 
quite sure what.  Inventors, and speculators, and pundits may have very 
firm ideas about its potential use, but those ideas are often very wrong. 
<P>	The natural habitat of the Goofy Prototype is in trade shows and in 
the popular press.   Infant technologies need publicity and investment 
money like a tottering calf need milk.  This was very true of Bell's 
machine.   To raise research and development money,  Bell toured with his 
device as a stage attraction. 
<P>	Contemporary press reports of the stage debut of the telephone 
showed pleased astonishment mixed with considerable dread.   Bell's stage 
telephone was a large wooden box with a crude speaker-nozzle, the whole 
contraption about the size and shape of an overgrown Brownie camera.   
Its buzzing steel soundplate, pumped up by powerful electromagnets,  was 
loud enough to fill an auditorium.  Bell's assistant Mr. Watson, who could 
manage on the keyboards fairly well, kicked in by playing the organ from 
distant rooms, and, later, distant cities. This feat was considered 
marvellous, but very eerie indeed. 
<P>	Bell's original notion for the telephone, an idea promoted for a 
couple of  years, was that it would become a mass medium.  We might 
recognize Bell's idea today as something close to modern "cable radio."    
Telephones  at a central source would transmit music, Sunday sermons, 
and important public speeches to a paying network of wired-up 
subscribers. 
<P>	At the time, most people thought this notion made good sense.    In 
fact, Bell's idea  was workable.  In Hungary, this philosophy of the 
telephone was successfully put into everyday practice.  In Budapest, for 
decades, from 1893 until after World War I, there was a government-run 
information  service called "Telefon Hirmondo½."   Hirmondo½ was a 
centralized source of news and entertainment and culture, including stock 
reports,  plays, concerts, and novels read aloud.  At certain hours of the 
day, the phone would ring, you would plug in a loudspeaker for the use of 
the family, and Telefon Hirmondo½ would be on the air -- or rather, on the 
phone. 
<P>	Hirmondo½ is dead tech today, but  Hirmondo½ might be 
considered a spiritual ancestor of the modern telephone-accessed computer 
data services, such as CompuServe, GEnie or Prodigy.  The principle 
behind Hirmondo½ is also not too far from computer "bulletinboard 
systems" or BBS's, which arrived in the late 1970s, spread rapidly across 
America, and will figure largely in this book. 
<P>	We are used to using telephones for individual person-to-person 
speech, because we are used to the Bell system.  But this was just one 
possibility among many. Communication networks are very flexible and 
protean, especially when their hardware becomes sufficiently advanced.  
They can be put to all kinds of uses.   And they have been -- and they will 
be. 
<P>	Bell's telephone was bound for glory, but this was a combination of 
political decisions, canny infighting in court, inspired industrial leadership, 
receptive local conditions and outright good luck.  Much the same is true 
of communications systems today. 
<P>	As Bell and his backers struggled to install their newfangled 
system in the real world of nineteenth-century New England, they had to 
fight against skepticism and industrial rivalry.  There was already a strong 
electrical communications network present in America: the telegraph.  The 
head of the Western Union telegraph system dismissed Bell's prototype as 
"an electrical toy" and refused to buy the rights to Bell's  patent.    The 
telephone, it seemed,  might be all right as a parlor entertainment -- but not 
for serious business. 
<P>	Telegrams, unlike mere telephones, left a permanent physical 
record of their messages.  Telegrams, unlike telephones,  could be 
answered whenever the recipient had time and convenience.  And the 
telegram had a much  longer distance-range than Bell's early telephone.  
These factors made telegraphy seem a much more sound and businesslike 
technology -- at least to some. 
<P>	The telegraph system was huge, and well-entrenched. In 1876, the 
United States had 214,000 miles of telegraph wire, and 8500 telegraph 
offices.  There were specialized telegraphs for businesses and stock 
traders, government, police and fire departments.  And Bell's "toy" was 
best known as a stage-magic musical device. 
<P>	The third stage of technology is known as the "Cash Cow" stage.   
In the "cash cow" stage, a technology finds its place in the world, and 
matures, and becomes settled and productive.   After a year or so,  
Alexander Graham Bell and his capitalist backers concluded that eerie 
music piped from nineteenth-century cyberspace was not the  real selling-
point of his invention.  Instead, the telephone was about speech -- 
individual, personal speech, the human voice, human conversation and  
human interaction.   The telephone was not to be managed from any 
centralized broadcast center.  It was to be a personal, intimate technology. 
<P>	When you picked up a telephone, you were not absorbing the cold 
output of a machine -- you were speaking to another human being.   Once 
people realized this, their instinctive dread of the telephone as an eerie, 
unnatural device, swiftly vanished.   A "telephone call" was not a "call" 
from a "telephone" itself,  but a call from another human being, someone 
you would generally know and recognize.   The real point was not what 
the machine could do for you (or to you), but what you yourself, a person 
and citizen, could do <I>through</I> the machine.  This decision on the part of 
the young Bell Company was absolutely vital. 
<P>	The first telephone networks went up around Boston - mostly 
among the technically curious and the well-to-do (much the same segment 
of the American populace that, a hundred years later, would be buying 
personal computers).  Entrenched backers of the telegraph continued to 
scoff. 
<P>	But in January 1878, a disaster made the telephone famous.   A 
train crashed in Tarriffville, Connecticut.  Forward-looking doctors in the 
nearby city of Hartford had had Bell's "speaking telephone" installed.    An 
alert local druggist was able to telephone an entire community of local 
doctors, who rushed to the site to give aid.  The disaster, as disasters do, 
aroused intense press coverage. The phone had proven its usefulness in the 
real world. 
<P>	After Tarriffville, the telephone network spread like crabgrass.  By 
1890 it was all over New England.  By '93, out to Chicago.  By '97, into 
Minnesota, Nebraska and Texas. By 1904 it was all over the continent. 
<P>	The telephone had become a mature technology. Professor Bell  
(now generally known as "Dr. Bell" despite his lack of a formal degree) 
became quite wealthy.   He lost interest in the tedious day-to-day business 
muddle of the booming telephone network, and gratefully returned his 
attention to creatively hacking-around in his  various laboratories, which 
were now much larger, betterventilated,  and gratifyingly better-equipped.   
Bell was never to have another great inventive success, though his 
speculations and prototypes anticipated fiber-optic transmission, manned 
flight, sonar, hydrofoil ships, tetrahedral construction, and Montessori 
education.   The "decibel," the standard scientific measure of sound 
intensity, was named after Bell. 
<P>	Not all Bell's vaporware notions were inspired.  He was fascinated 
by human eugenics.   He also spent many years developing a weird 
personal system of astrophysics in which gravity did not exist. 
<P>	Bell was a definite eccentric.  He was something of a 
hypochondriac, and throughout his life he habitually stayed up until four 
A.M., refusing to rise before noon. But Bell had accomplished a great feat; 
he was an idol of millions and his influence, wealth, and great personal 
charm, combined with his eccentricity, made him something of a loose 
cannon on deck.   Bell maintained a thriving scientific salon in his winter 
mansion in Washington, D.C., which gave him considerable backstage 
influence in governmental and scientific circles.   He was a major financial 
backer of the the magazines <I>Science</I> and <I>National Geographic,</I> both  
still flourishing today as important organs of the American scientific 
establishment. Bell's companion Thomas Watson, similarly wealthy and 
similarly odd, became the ardent political disciple of a 19th-century 
science-fiction writer and would-be social reformer, Edward Bellamy.  
Watson also trod the boards briefly as a Shakespearian actor. 
<P>	There would never be another Alexander Graham Bell, but in years 
to come there would be surprising numbers of people like him.  Bell was a 
prototype of the high-tech entrepreneur.   High-tech entrepreneurs will 
play a very prominent role in this book: not merely as technicians and 
businessmen, but as pioneers of the technical frontier, who can carry the 
power and prestige they derive from high-technology into the political and 
social arena. 
<P>	Like later entrepreneurs, Bell was fierce in defense of his own 
technological territory.  As the telephone began to flourish, Bell was soon 
involved in violent lawsuits in the defense of his patents.  Bell's Boston 
lawyers were excellent, however, and Bell himself, as an elecution teacher 
and gifted public speaker, was a devastatingly effective legal witness.  In 
the eighteen years of  Bell's patents, the Bell company was involved in six 
hundred separate lawsuits.  The legal records printed filled 149 volumes.   
The Bell Company won every single suit. 
<P>	After Bell's exclusive patents expired, rival telephone companies 
sprang up all over America.  Bell's company, American Bell Telephone, 
was soon in deep trouble.  In 1907, American Bell Telephone fell into the 
hands of the rather sinister J.P. Morgan financial cartel, robber-baron 
speculators who dominated Wall Street. 
<P>	At this point, history might have taken a different turn.  American 
might well have been served forever by a patchwork of locally owned 
telephone companies.   Many state politicians and local businessmen 
considered this an excellent solution. 
<P>	But the new Bell holding company, American Telephone and 
Telegraph or AT&T, put in a new man at the helm, a visionary industrialist 
named Theodore Vail. Vail, a former Post Office manager, understood 
large organizations and had an innate feeling for the nature of large-scale 
communications.   Vail quickly saw to it that AT&T seized the 
technological edge once again.   The Pupin and Campbell "loading coil," 
and the deForest "audion," are both extinct technology today, but in 1913 
they gave Vail's company the best <I>long-distance</I>  lines ever built.  By 
controlling long-distance -- the links between, and over, and above the 
smaller local phone companies -- AT&T swiftly gained the whip-hand 
over them, and was soon devouring them right and left. 
<P>	Vail plowed the profits back into research and  development, 
starting the Bell tradition of huge-scale and brilliant industrial research. 
<P>	Technically and financially, AT&T gradually steamrollered the 
opposition.  Independent telephone companies never became entirely 
extinct, and hundreds of them flourish today.  But Vail's  AT&T became 
the supreme communications company.   At one point, Vail's AT&T 
bought Western Union itself, the very company that had derided Bell's 
telephone as a "toy."   Vail thoroughly reformed Western Union's 
hidebound business along his modern principles;  but when the  federal 
government grew anxious at this centralization of power, Vail politely  
gave Western Union back. 
<P>	This centralizing process was not unique.  Very similar  events had 
happened in American steel, oil, and railroads.   But AT&T, unlike the 
other companies, was to remain supreme.  The monopoly robber-barons of 
those other industries were humbled and shattered by government trust-
busting. Vail, the former Post Office official, was quite willing to 
accommodate the US government; in fact he would forge an active 
alliance with it.   AT&T would become almost a wing of the American 
government, almost another Post Office -- though not quite.   AT&T 
would willingly submit to federal regulation, but in return, it would use the 
government's regulators as its own police, who would keep out 
competitors and assure the Bell system's profits and preeminence. 
<P>	This was the second birth -- the political birth -- of the American 
telephone system.  Vail's arrangement was to persist, with vast success, for 
many decades, until 1982. His system was an odd kind of American 
industrial socialism.  It was born at about the same time as Leninist 
Communism, and it lasted almost as long -- and, it must be admitted, to 
considerably better effect. 
<P>	Vail's system worked.  Except perhaps for aerospace, there has 
been no technology more thoroughly dominated by Americans than the 
telephone.   The telephone was seen from the beginning as a 
quintessentially American technology.   Bell's policy, and the policy of 
Theodore Vail, was a profoundly democratic policy of <I>universal access.</I> 
Vail's famous corporate slogan, "One Policy, One System, Universal 
Service," was a political slogan, with a very American ring to it. The 
American telephone was not to become the specialized tool of government 
or business, but a general public utility.  At first, it was true, only the 
wealthy could afford private telephones, and Bell's company pursued the 
business markets primarily.   The American phone system was a capitalist 
effort, meant to make money; it was not a charity.  But from the first, 
almost all communities with telephone service had public telephones.  And 
many stores -- especially drugstores -offered public use of their phones.  
You might not own a  telephone -- but you could always get into the 
system, if you really needed to. 
<P>	There was nothing inevitable about this decision to make 
telephones "public" and "universal."   Vail's system involved a profound 
act of trust in the public.  This decision was a political one, informed by 
the basic values of the American republic.  The situation might have been 
very different;  and in other countries, under other systems, it certainly 
was. 
<P>	Joseph Stalin, for instance, vetoed plans for a Soviet phone system 
soon after the Bolshevik revolution.  Stalin was certain that publicly 
accessible telephones would become instruments of anti-Soviet 
counterrevolution and conspiracy.   (He was probably right.)  When 
telephones did arrive in the Soviet Union, they would be instruments of 
Party authority, and always heavily tapped.  (Alexander Solzhenitsyn's  
prison-camp novel <I>The First Circle</I> describes efforts to develop a phone 
system more suited to Stalinist purposes.) 
<P>	France, with its tradition of rational centralized government, had 
fought bitterly even against the electric telegraph, which seemed to the 
French entirely too anarchical and frivolous.   For decades, nineteenth-
century France communicated via the "visual telegraph," a nation-
spanning, government-owned  semaphore system of huge stone towers that 
signalled from hilltops, across vast distances, with big windmill-like arms.  
In 1846, one Dr. Barbay, a semaphore enthusiast, memorably uttered an 
early version of what might be called "the security expert's argument" 
against the open media. 
<P>	"No, the electric telegraph is not a sound invention. It will always 
be at the mercy of the slightest disruption, wild youths, drunkards, bums, 
etc....  The electric telegraph meets those destructive elements with only a 
few meters of wire over which supervision is impossible.  A single man 
could, without being seen, cut the telegraph wires leading to Paris, and in 
twenty-four hours cut in ten different places the wires of the same line, 
without being arrested. The visual telegraph, on the contrary, has its 
towers, its high walls, its gates well-guarded from inside by strong armed 
men.  Yes, I declare, substitution of the electric telegraph for the visual 
one is a dreadful measure, a truly idiotic act." 
<P>	Dr. Barbay and his high-security stone machines were eventually 
unsuccessful, but his argument -- that communication  exists for the safety 
and convenience of the state, and must be carefully protected from the 
wild boys and the gutter rabble  who might want to crash the system -- 
would be heard again and again.


<P>	When the French telephone system finally did arrive, its snarled 
inadequacy was to be notorious.  Devotees of the American Bell System 
often recommended a trip to France, for skeptics. 
<P>	In Edwardian Britain, issues of class and privacy were a ball-and-
chain for telephonic progress.   It was considered outrageous that anyone -- 
any wild fool off the street -- could simply barge bellowing into one's 
office or home, preceded only by the ringing of a telephone bell.  In 
Britain, phones were tolerated for the use of business, but private phones 
tended be stuffed away into closets, smoking rooms, or servants' quarters.  
Telephone operators were resented in Britain because they did not seem to 
"know their place."   And no one of breeding would print a telephone 
number on a business card; this seemed a crass attempt to make the 
acquaintance of strangers. 
<P>	But phone access in America was to become a popular right; 
something like universal suffrage, only more so.  American women could 
not yet vote when the phone system came through; yet from the beginning 
American women doted on the telephone.  This "feminization" of the 
American telephone was often commented on by foreigners.   Phones in 
America were not censored or stiff or  formalized; they were social, 
private, intimate, and domestic.   In America, Mother's Day is by far the 
busiest day of the year for the phone network. 
<P>	The early telephone companies, and especially AT&T, were among 
the foremost employers of American women.  They employed the 
daughters of the American middle-class in great armies: in 1891, eight 
thousand women; by 1946, almost a quarter of a million.   Women  
seemed to enjoy telephone work; it was respectable, it was steady, it paid 
fairly well as women's work went, and -- not least -- it seemed a genuine 
contribution to the social good of the community.   Women found Vail's 
ideal of public service attractive.  This was especially true in rural areas, 
where women operators, running extensive rural partylines, enjoyed 
considerable social power.   The operator knew everyone on the party-line, 
and everyone knew her. 
<P>	Although Bell himself was an ardent suffragist, the telephone 
company did not employ women for the sake of advancing female 
liberation.  AT&T  did this for sound commercial reasons.  The first 
telephone operators of the Bell system were not women, but teenage 
American boys. They were telegraphic  messenger boys (a group about to 
be rendered technically obsolescent), who swept up around the phone 
office, dunned customers for bills, and made phone connections on the 
switchboard, all on the cheap. 
<P>	Within the very first  year of operation, 1878, Bell's company 
learned a sharp lesson about combining teenage boys and telephone 
switchboards.   Putting teenage boys in charge of the phone system 
brought swift and consistent disaster.  Bell's chief engineer described them 
as "Wild Indians."  The boys were openly rude to customers.  They talked 
back to subscribers, saucing off, uttering facetious remarks, and generally 
giving lip.  The rascals took Saint Patrick's Day off without permission. 
And worst of all they played clever tricks with the switchboard plugs:  
disconnecting calls, crossing lines so that customers found themselves 
talking to strangers, and so forth. 
<P>	This combination of power, technical mastery, and effective 
anonymity seemed to act like catnip on teenage boys. 
<P>	This wild-kid-on-the-wires phenomenon was not confined to the 
USA; from the beginning, the same was true of the British phone system.   
An early British commentator kindly remarked:  "No doubt boys in their 
teens found the work not a little irksome, and it is also highly probable that 
under the early conditions of employment the adventurous and inquisitive 
spirits of which the average healthy boy of that age is possessed, were not 
always conducive to the best attention being given to the wants of the 
telephone subscribers." 
<P>	So the boys were flung off the system -- or at least, deprived of 
control of the switchboard.  But the "adventurous and inquisitive spirits" 
of the teenage boys would be heard from in the world of telephony, again 
and again. 
<P>	The fourth stage in the technological life-cycle is death:  "the Dog," 
dead tech.   The telephone has so far avoided this fate.  On the contrary, it 
is thriving, still spreading, still evolving, and at increasing speed. 
<P>	The telephone has achieved a rare and exalted state for a 
technological artifact:  it has become a <I>household object.</I>    The 
telephone, like the clock, like pen and paper, like kitchen utensils and  
running water, has become a technology that is visible only by its absence. 
The telephone is technologically transparent.  The global telephone system 
is the largest and most complex machine in the world, yet it is easy to use.  
More remarkable yet,  the telephone is almost entirely physically safe for 
the user. 
<P>	For the average citizen in the 1870s, the telephone was weirder, 
more shocking, more "high-tech" and harder to comprehend, than the most 
outrageous stunts of advanced computing for us Americans in the 1990s.   
In trying to understand what is happening to us today, with  our bulletin-
board systems, direct overseas dialling, fiberoptic transmissions, computer 
viruses, hacking stunts, and a vivid tangle of new laws and new crimes, it 
is important to realize that our society has been through a similar challenge 
before -- and that, all in all, we did rather well by it. 
<P>	Bell's stage telephone seemed bizarre at first.  But the sensations of 
weirdness vanished quickly, once people began to hear the familiar voices 
of relatives and friends, in their own homes on their own telephones.   The 
telephone changed from a fearsome high-tech totem to an everyday pillar 
of human community. 
<P>	This has also happened, and is still happening, to computer 
networks.   Computer networks  such as NSFnet, BITnet,  USENET, 
JANET,  are technically advanced, intimidating, and much harder to use 
than telephones.  Even the popular, commercial computer networks, such 
as GEnie, Prodigy, and CompuServe, cause much head-scratching and 
have been described as  "user-hateful."   Nevertheless they too are 
changing from fancy high-tech items into everyday sources of human 
community. 
<P>	The words "community" and "communication" have the same root.   
Wherever you put a communications network, you put a community as 
well.  And whenever you <I>take away</I>  that network -- confiscate it, 
outlaw it, crash it, raise its price beyond affordability -- then you hurt that 
community. 
<P>	Communities  will fight to defend themselves.  People will fight 
harder and more bitterly to defend their communities,  than they will fight 
to defend their own individual selves.   And this is very true of the 
"electronic community" that arose around computer networks in the 1980s  
-- or rather, the <I>various</I> electronic communities, in telephony, law 
enforcement, computing, and the digital  underground that, by  the year 
1990, were raiding, rallying, arresting, suing, jailing, fining and issuing 
angry manifestos. 
<P>	None of the events of 1990 were entirely new. Nothing happened 
in 1990 that did not have some kind of earlier and more understandable 
precedent.   What gave the Hacker Crackdown its new sense of gravity and 
importance was the feeling -- the <I>community</I> feeling - that the political 
stakes had been raised; that trouble in cyberspace was no longer mere 
mischief or inconclusive skirmishing, but a genuine fight over genuine 
issues, a fight for community survival and the shape of the future. These 
electronic communities, having flourished throughout the 1980s, were 
becoming aware of themselves, and increasingly, becoming aware of 
other, rival communities.   Worries were sprouting up right and left, with 
complaints, rumors, uneasy speculations.   But it would take a catalyst, a 
shock, to make the new world evident.   Like Bell's great publicity break, 
the Tarriffville Rail Disaster of January 1878, it would take a cause 
celebre. 
<P>	That cause was the AT&T Crash of January 15, 1990. After the 
Crash, the wounded and anxious telephone community would come out 
fighting hard. 
<P>	The community of telephone technicians, engineers, operators and 
researchers is the oldest community in cyberspace.   These are the 
veterans, the most developed group,  the richest, the most respectable, in 
most ways the most powerful.   Whole generations  have come and gone 
since Alexander Graham Bell's day, but the community he founded 
survives; people work for the phone system today whose great-
grandparents worked for the phone system. Its specialty magazines, such 
as <I>Telephony,</I>  <I>AT&T Technical Journal,</I>   <I>Telephone Engineer and 
Management,</I>  are decades old; they make computer publications like 
<I>Macworld</I> and <I>PC Week</I>  look like amateur johnny-come-latelies. 
<P>	And the phone companies take no back seat in hightechnology, 
either.  Other companies' industrial researchers may have won new 
markets;  but the researchers of Bell Labs have won <I>seven  Nobel 
Prizes.</I>  One potent device that Bell Labs originated, the transistor, has 
created entire <I>groups</I> of industries.  Bell Labs are world-famous for 
generating "a patent a day," and have even made vital discoveries in 
astronomy, physics and cosmology. 
<P>	Throughout its seventy-year history, "Ma Bell" was not so much a 
company as a way of life.  Until the cataclysmic divestiture of the 1980s, 
Ma Bell was perhaps the ultimate maternalist mega-employer.   The 
AT&T corporate image was the "gentle giant,"  "the voice with a smile," a 
vaguely socialist-realist world of cleanshaven linemen in shiny helmets 
and blandly pretty phone-girls in headsets and nylons.   Bell System 
employees were famous as rock-ribbed Kiwanis and Rotary members, 
Little-League enthusiasts, school-board people. 
<P>	During the long heyday of Ma Bell, the Bell employee corps were 
nurtured top-to-botton on a  corporate ethos of public service.   There was 
good money in Bell, but Bell was not <I>about</I> money; Bell used public 
relations, but never mere marketeering.   People went into the Bell System 
for a good life, and they had a good life. But it was not mere money that 
led Bell people out in the midst of storms and earthquakes to fight with 
toppled phone-poles, to wade in flooded manholes, to pull the redeyed 
graveyard-shift over collapsing switching-systems. The Bell ethic was the 
electrical equivalent of the postman's: neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of 
night would stop these couriers. 
<P>	It is easy to be cynical about this, as it is easy to be cynical about 
any political or social system;  but cynicism does not change the fact that 
thousands of people took these ideals very seriously.   And some still do. 
<P>	The Bell ethos was about public service; and that was gratifying; 
but it was also about private <I>power,</I> and that was gratifying too.   As a 
corporation, Bell was very special. Bell was privileged.  Bell had snuggled 
up close to the state.  In fact, Bell was as close to government as you could 
get in America and still make a whole lot of legitimate money. 
<P>	But unlike other companies,  Bell was above and beyond the vulgar 
commercial fray.  Through its regional operating companies, Bell was 
omnipresent, local, and  intimate, all over America;  but the central ivory 
towers at its corporate heart were the tallest and the ivoriest around. 
<P>	There were other phone companies in America, to be sure;
the so-called independents.  Rural cooperatives, mostly; small fry, 
mostly tolerated, sometimes warred upon.
<P>	For many decades, "independent" American phone companies 
lived in fear and loathing of the official Bell monopoly  (or the "Bell 
Octopus," as Ma Bell's nineteenthcentury enemies described her in many 
angry newspaper manifestos).  Some few of these independent 
entrepreneurs,  while legally in the wrong,  fought so bitterly against the 
Octopus that their illegal phone networks were cast into the street by Bell 
agents and publicly burned. 
<P>	The pure technical sweetness of the Bell System gave its operators, 
inventors and engineers a deeply satisfying sense of power and mastery.  
They had devoted their lives to improving this vast nation-spanning 
machine; over years, whole human lives, they had watched it improve  and 
grow.   It was like a great technological  temple.  They were an elite, and 
they knew it -- even if others did not; in fact, they felt even more powerful 
<I>because</I> others did not understand. The deep attraction of this sensation  
of elite technical power should never be underestimated. "Technical 
power" is not for everybody; for many people it simply has no charm at all.  
But for some people, it becomes the core of their lives.  For a few, it is 
overwhelming, obsessive;  it becomes something close to an addiction.   
People -- especially clever teenage boys whose lives are otherwise mostly 
powerless and put-upon -  love this sensation of secret power, and are 
willing to do all sorts of amazing things to achieve it.  The technical 
<I>power</I> of electronics has motivated many  strange acts detailed in this 
book, which would otherwise be inexplicable. 
<P>	So Bell had power beyond mere capitalism.  The Bell service  
ethos worked, and was often propagandized, in a rather saccharine fashion.  
Over the decades,  people  slowly grew tired of this.   And then, openly 
impatient with it.  By the early 1980s, Ma Bell was to find herself with 
scarcely a real friend in the world.   Vail's industrial socialism had become 
hopelessly out-of-fashion politically.  Bell would be punished for that.  
And that punishment would fall harshly upon the people of the telephone 
community. 
<P>	In 1983, Ma Bell was dismantled by federal court action.  The 
pieces of Bell are now separate corporate entities.  The core of the 
company became AT&T Communications, and also AT&T  Industries 
(formerly Western Electric, Bell's manufacturing arm).  AT&T Bell Labs 
become Bell Communications Research, Bellcore. Then there are the 
Regional Bell Operating Companies, or  RBOCs, pronounced "arbocks." 
<P>	Bell was a titan and even these regional chunks are gigantic 
enterprises:  Fortune 50 companies with plenty of wealth and power 
behind them.     But the clean lines of "One Policy, One System, Universal 
Service" have been shattered, apparently forever. 
<P>	The "One Policy" of the early Reagan Administration was to 
shatter a system that smacked of noncompetitive socialism.  Since that 
time, there has been no real telephone "policy" on the federal level.  
Despite the breakup, the remnants of Bell have never been set free to 
compete in the open marketplace. 
<P>	The RBOCs are still very heavily regulated, but not from the top.  
Instead, they struggle politically, economically and legally, in what seems 
an endless turmoil, in a patchwork of overlapping federal and state 
jurisdictions.   Increasingly, like other major American corporations, the 
RBOCs  are becoming multinational, acquiring important commercial 
interests in Europe, Latin  America, and the Pacific Rim.  But this, too, 
adds to their legal and political predicament. 
<P>	The people of what used to be Ma Bell are not happy about their 
fate.  They feel ill-used.  They might have been grudgingly willing to make 
a full transition to the free market; to become just companies amid other 
companies. But this never happened.   Instead,  AT&T and the RBOCS 
("the Baby Bells")  feel themselves wrenched from side to side by state 
regulators, by Congress, by the FCC,  and especially by the federal court of 
Judge Harold Greene, the magistrate who ordered the Bell breakup and 
who has been the de facto czar of American telecommunications ever 
since 1983. 
<P>	Bell people feel that they exist in a kind of paralegal limbo today.   
They don't understand what's demanded of them.   If it's "service," why 
aren't they treated like a public service?  And if it's money, then why aren't 
they free to compete for it?  No one seems to know, really.   Those who 
claim to know  keep changing their minds.  Nobody in authority seems 
willing to grasp the nettle for once and all. 
<P>	Telephone people from other countries are amazed by the 
American telephone system today.  Not that it works so well; for 
nowadays even the French telephone system works, more or less.  They are 
amazed that the American telephone system <I>still</I>  works <I>at all,</I> under 
these strange conditions. 
<P>	Bell's  "One System" of long-distance service is now only about 
eighty percent of a system, with the remainder held by Sprint, MCI, and 
the midget long-distance companies.   Ugly wars over dubious corporate 
practices such as "slamming" (an underhanded method of snitching clients 
from rivals) break out with some regularity in the realm of long-distance 
service.  The battle to break Bell's long-distance monopoly was long and 
ugly, and since the breakup the battlefield has not become much prettier. 
AT&T's famous shame-and-blame advertisements, which emphasized the 
shoddy work and purported ethical shadiness of their competitors,  were 
much remarked on for their studied psychological cruelty. There is much 
bad blood in this industry, and much long-treasured resentment.  AT&T's 
post-breakup corporate logo, a striped sphere, is known in the industry as 
the "Death Star"  (a reference from the movie <I>Star Wars,</I> in which the 
"Death Star" was the spherical  hightech fortress of the harsh-breathing  
imperial ultra-baddie, Darth Vader.)   Even AT&T employees are less than 
thrilled by the Death Star.   A popular (though banned) Tshirt among 
AT&T employees bears the old-fashioned Bell logo of the Bell System, 
plus the newfangled striped sphere, with the before-and-after comments:  
"This is your brain -- This is your brain on drugs!"   AT&T made a very 
well-financed and determined effort to break into the personal computer 
market;  it was disastrous, and telco computer experts are derisively 
known by their competitors as "the pole-climbers."  AT&T and the Baby 
Bell arbocks still seem to have few friends. Under conditions of sharp 
commercial competition, a crash like that of January 15, 1990 was a major  
embarrassment to AT&T.  It was a direct blow against their much-
treasured reputation for reliability.   Within days of the crash AT&T's 
Chief Executive Officer, Bob Allen, officially apologized, in terms of 
deeply pained  humility: "AT&T had a major service disruption last 
Monday. We didn't live up to our own standards of quality, and we didn't 
live up to yours. It's as simple as that.  And that's not acceptable to us.  Or 
to you.... We understand how much people have come to depend upon 
AT&T service, so our AT&T Bell Laboratories scientists and our network 
engineers are doing everything possible to guard against a recurrence.... 
We know there's no way to make up for the inconvenience this problem 
may have caused you." 
<P>	Mr Allen's "open letter to customers" was printed in lavish ads all 
over the country:  in the <I>Wall Street Journal,  USA Today, New 
York Times, Los Angeles Times,  Chicago Tribune, Philadelphia 
Inquirer,  San Francisco Chronicle Examiner, Boston Globe,
Dallas Morning News, Detroit Free Press, Washington Post,
Houston Chronicle, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Atlanta Journal 
Constitution, Minneapolis Star Tribune, St. Paul Pioneer Press 
Dispatch,  Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer, Tacoma News Tribune,
Miami Herald, Pittsburgh  Press,  St. Louis Post Dispatch, Denver 
Post, Phoenix Republic Gazette</I> and <I>Tampa Tribune.</I> 
<P>	In another press release, AT&T went to some pains to suggest that 
this "software glitch" <I>might</I> have happened just as easily to MCI, 
although, in fact, it hadn't.  (MCI's switching software was quite different 
from AT&T's -though not necessarily any safer.)   AT&T also announced 
their plans to offer a rebate of service on Valentine's Day to make up for 
the loss during the Crash. 
<P>	"Every technical resource available, including Bell Labs scientists 
and engineers, has been devoted to assuring it will not occur again," the 
public was told. They were further assured that "The chances of a 
recurrence are small--a problem of this magnitude never occurred before." 
<P>	In the meantime, however, police and corporate security 
maintained their own suspicions about "the chances of recurrence" and the 
real reason why a "problem of this magnitude" had appeared, seemingly 
out of nowhere.   Police and security knew for a fact that hackers of 
unprecedented sophistication were illegally entering, and reprogramming, 
certain digital switching stations.  Rumors of hidden "viruses" and secret 
"logic bombs" in the switches ran rampant in the underground, with much 
chortling over AT&T's predicament, and idle speculation over what 
unsung hacker genius was responsible for it.  Some hackers, including 
police informants, were trying hard to finger one another as the true 
culprits  of the Crash. 
<P>	Telco people found little comfort in objectivity when they 
contemplated these possibilities.   It was just too close to the bone for 
them; it was embarrassing; it hurt so much, it was hard even to talk about. 
<P>	There has always been thieving and misbehavior in the phone 
system.  There has always been trouble with the rival independents, and in 
the local loops.  But to have such trouble in the core of the system, the 
long-distance switching stations, is a horrifying affair.   To telco people, 
this is all the difference between finding roaches in your kitchen and big 
horrid sewer-rats in your bedroom. 
<P>	From the outside, to the average citizen, the telcos still seem 
gigantic and impersonal.  The American public seems to regard them as 
something akin to Soviet apparats.  Even when the telcos  do their best 
corporatecitizen routine,  subsidizing magnet high-schools and sponsoring 
news-shows on public television, they seem to win little except public 
suspicion. 
<P>	But from the inside, all this looks very different. There's harsh 
competition.  A legal and political system  that seems baffled  and bored, 
when not actively hostile to telco interests.  There's a loss of morale, a 
deep sensation of having somehow lost the upper hand.  Technological 
change has caused a loss of data and revenue to other, newer forms of 
transmission.   There's theft, and new forms of theft, of growing scale and 
boldness and  sophistication.  With all these factors, it was no surprise to 
see the telcos, large and small, break out in a litany of bitter complaint. 
<P>	In late '88 and throughout 1989, telco representatives grew shrill in 
their complaints to those few American law enforcement officials who 
make it their business to try to understand what telephone people are 
talking about. Telco security officials had discovered the computerhacker 
underground, infiltrated it thoroughly, and become deeply alarmed at its 
growing expertise.  Here  they had found a target that was not only 
loathsome on its face, but clearly ripe for counterattack. 
<P>	Those bitter rivals: AT&T, MCI and Sprint -- and a crowd of Baby 
Bells:  PacBell, Bell South, Southwestern Bell, NYNEX, USWest, as well 
as the Bell research consortium Bellcore, and the independent long-
distance  carrier  Mid-American  -- all were to have their role in the great 
hacker dragnet of 1990.   After years of being battered and pushed around, 
the telcos had, at least in a small way, seized the initiative again.  After 
years of turmoil, telcos and government officials were once again to work 
smoothly in concert in defense of the System. Optimism blossomed; 
enthusiasm grew on all sides; the prospective taste of vengeance was 
sweet. 
<P>	From the beginning -- even before the crackdown had a name -- 
secrecy was a big problem.  There were many good reasons for secrecy in 
the hacker crackdown.  Hackers and code-thieves were wily prey, slinking 
back to their bedrooms and basements and destroying vital incriminating 
evidence at the first hint of trouble. Furthermore, the crimes themselves 
were heavily  technical and difficult to describe, even to police -- much 
less to the general public. 
<P>	When such crimes <I>had</I> been described intelligibly to the public, 
in the past, that very publicity had tended to <I>increase</I> the crimes 
enormously.   Telco officials, while painfully aware of the vulnerabilities 
of their systems, were anxious not to publicize those weaknesses.   
Experience showed them that those weaknesses, once discovered, would 
be pitilessly exploited by tens of thousands of people -- not only by 
professional grifters and by underground hackers and phone phreaks, but 
by many otherwise more-or-less honest everyday folks, who regarded 
stealing service from the faceless, soulless "Phone Company" as a kind of 
harmless indoor sport.  When it came to protecting their interests, telcos 
had long since given up on general public sympathy for "the Voice with a 
Smile."  Nowadays the telco's "Voice" was very likely to be a computer's; 
and the American public showed much less of the proper respect and 
gratitude due the fine public service bequeathed them by Dr. Bell and Mr. 
Vail. The more efficient, high-tech, computerized, and impersonal the 
telcos became, it seemed, the more they were met by sullen public 
resentment and amoral greed. 
<P>	Telco officials wanted to punish the phone-phreak underground,  in 
as public and exemplary a manner as possible.  They wanted to make dire 
examples of the worst offenders, to seize the ringleaders and intimidate the 
small fry, to discourage and frighten the wacky hobbyists, and send the 
professional grifters to jail.  To do all this, publicity was vital. 
<P>	Yet operational secrecy was even more so.  If word got out that a 
nationwide crackdown was coming, the hackers might simply vanish; 
destroy the evidence, hide their computers, go to earth, and wait for the 
campaign to blow over.  Even the young  hackers were crafty and 
suspicious, and as for the professional grifters, they tended to split for the 
nearest state-line at the first sign of trouble.  For the crackdown to work 
well, they would all have to be caught red-handed, swept upon suddenly, 
out of the blue, from every corner of the compass. And there was another 
strong motive for secrecy.  In the worst-case scenario, a blown campaign 
might leave the telcos open to a devastating hacker counter-attack.   If 
there were indeed hackers loose in America  who had caused the January 
15 Crash -- if there were truly gifted hackers, loose in the nation's long-
distance switching systems, and enraged or frightened by the crackdown --
then they might react unpredictably to an attempt to  collar them.   Even if 
caught, they might have talented and vengeful friends still running around 
loose.   Conceivably, it could turn ugly.  Very ugly.  In fact, it was hard to 
imagine just how ugly things might turn, given that possibility. Counter-
attack from hackers was a genuine concern for the telcos.  In point of fact, 
they would never suffer any such counter-attack.  But in months to come, 
they would be at some pains to publicize this notion and to utter grim 
warnings about it. 
<P>	Still, that risk seemed well worth running.  Better to run the risk of 
vengeful attacks, than to live at the mercy of potential crashers.  Any cop 
would tell you that a protection racket had no real future. 
<P>	And publicity was such a useful thing.   Corporate security officers, 
including telco security,  generally work under conditions of great 
discretion.  And corporate security officials do not make money for their 
companies. Their job is to <I>prevent the loss</I> of money, which is much 
less glamorous than actually winning profits. If you are a corporate 
security official, and you do your job brilliantly, then nothing bad happens 
to your company at all.  Because of this, you appear completely 
superfluous.   This is one of the many unattractive aspects of security 
work.   It's rare that these folks have the chance to draw some healthy 
attention to their own efforts. 
<P>	Publicity also served the interest of their friends in law 
enforcement.  Public officials, including law enforcement officials,  thrive 
by attracting favorable public interest.  A brilliant prosecution in a matter 
of vital public interest  can make the career of a prosecuting attorney.  And 
for a police officer, good publicity opens the purses of the legislature; it 
may bring a citation, or a promotion, or at least a rise in status and the 
respect of one's peers. 
<P>	But to have both publicity and secrecy is to have one's cake and eat 
it too.  In months to come, as we will show, this impossible act was to 
cause great pain to the agents of the crackdown.  But early on, it seemed 
possible -- maybe even likely -- that the crackdown could successfully 
combine the best of both worlds.   The <I>arrest</I> of hackers would be 
heavily publicized.  The actual <I>deeds</I> of the hackers, which were 
technically hard to explain and also a security risk, would be left decently 
obscured.   The <I>threat</I> hackers posed would be heavily trumpeted; the 
likelihood of their actually committing such fearsome crimes would be left 
to the public's imagination.  The spread of the computer underground, and 
its growing technical sophistication, would be heavily promoted;  the 
actual hackers themselves, mostly bespectacled middle-class white 
suburban teenagers, would be denied any personal publicity. 
<P>	It does not seem to have occurred to any telco official that the 
hackers accused would demand a day in court; that journalists would smile 
upon the hackers as "good copy;"  that wealthy high-tech entrepreneurs 
would offer moral and financial support to crackdown victims; that 
constitutional lawyers would show up with briefcases, frowning mightily.   
This possibility does not seem to have ever entered the game-plan. 
<P>	And even if it had, it probably would not have slowed the ferocious 
pursuit of a stolen phone-company document, mellifluously known as 
"Control Office Administration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special 
Services and Major Account Centers." 
<P>	In the chapters to follow, we will explore the worlds of police and 
the computer underground, and the large shadowy area where they overlap.   
But first, we must  explore the battleground.  Before we leave the world of 
the telcos, we must understand what a switching system actually is and 
how your telephone actually works. 
<P>	To the average citizen, the idea of the telephone is represented by, 
well,  a <I>telephone:</I>  a device that you talk into.
<P>	
<P>	To a telco professional, however, the telephone itself is known, in 
lordly fashion, as a "subset."   The "subset" in your house is a mere 
adjunct, a distant nerve ending, of the central switching stations, which are 
ranked in levels of heirarchy, up to the  long-distance electronic switching 
stations, which are some of the largest computers on earth. 
<P>	Let us imagine that it is, say, 1925,  before the introduction of 
computers, when the phone system was simpler and somewhat easier to 
grasp.   Let's further imagine that you are Miss Leticia Luthor, a fictional 
operator for Ma Bell in New York City of the 20s. 
<P>	Basically, you, Miss Luthor, <I>are</I> the "switching system."  You 
are sitting in front of a large vertical switchboard, known as a "cordboard," 
made of shiny wooden panels, with ten thousand metal-rimmed holes 
punched in them, known as jacks.  The engineers would have put more 
holes into your switchboard, but ten thousand is as many as you can reach 
without actually having to get up out of your chair. 
<P>	Each of these ten thousand holes has its own little electric 
lightbulb, known as a "lamp," and its own neatly printed number code. 
<P>	With the ease of long habit, you are scanning your board for lit-up 
bulbs.  This is what you do most of the time, so you are used to it. 
<P>	A lamp lights up.  This means that the phone at the end of that line 
has been taken off the hook.   Whenever a handset is taken off the hook, 
that closes a circuit inside the phone which then signals the local office, 
i.e. you, automatically.  There might be somebody calling, or then again 
the phone might be simply off the hook, but this does not matter to you 
yet.  The first thing you do, is record that number in your logbook, in your 
fine American public-school handwriting.   This comes first, naturally, 
since it is done for billing purposes. 
<P>	You now take the plug of your answering cord, which goes directly 
to your headset, and plug it into the lit-up hole.  "Operator," you announce. 
<P>	In operator's classes, before taking this job, you have been issued a 
large pamphlet full of canned operator's responses for all kinds of 
contingencies, which you had to memorize.  You have also been trained in 
a proper nonregional, non-ethnic pronunciation and tone of voice.  You 
rarely  have the occasion to make any spontaneous remark to a customer, 
and in fact this is frowned upon (except out on the rural lines where people  
have time on their hands and get up to all kinds of mischief). 
<P>	A tough-sounding user's voice at the end of the line gives you a 
number.  Immediately, you write that number down in your logbook, next 
to the caller's number, which you just wrote earlier.  You then look and see 
if the number this guy wants is in fact on your switchboard, which it 
generally is, since it's generally a local call. Long distance costs so much 
that people use it sparingly. 
<P>	Only then do you pick up a calling-cord from a shelf  at the base of 
the switchboard.  This is a long elastic cord mounted on a kind of reel so 
that it will zip back in when you unplug it.  There are a lot of cords down 
there, and when a bunch of them are out at once they look like a nest of 
snakes.  Some of the girls think there are bugs living in those cable-holes.  
They're called "cable mites" and are supposed to bite your hands and give 
you rashes.  You don't believe this, yourself. 
<P>	Gripping the head of your calling-cord, you slip the tip of it deftly 
into the sleeve of the jack for the called person.  Not all the way in, 
though.  You just touch it.  If you hear a clicking sound, that means the 
line is busy and you can't put the call through.  If the line is busy, you have 
to stick the calling-cord into a "busy-tone jack," which will give the guy a 
busy-tone.  This way you don't have to talk to him yourself and absorb his 
natural human frustration. 
<P>	But the line isn't busy.  So you pop the cord all the way in.   Relay 
circuits in your board make the distant phone ring, and if somebody picks 
it up off the hook, then a phone conversation starts.   You can hear this 
conversation on your answering cord, until you unplug it. In fact you could 
listen to the whole conversation if you wanted, but this is sternly frowned 
upon by management, and frankly, when you've overheard one, you've 
pretty much heard 'em all. 
<P>	You can tell how long the conversation lasts by the glow of the 
calling-cord's lamp, down on the calling-cord's shelf.   When it's over, you 
unplug and the calling-cord zips back into place. 
<P>	Having done this stuff a few hundred thousand times, you become 
quite good at it.  In fact you're plugging, and connecting, and 
disconnecting, ten, twenty, forty cords at a time.  It's a manual handicraft, 
really, quite satisfying in a way, rather like weaving on an upright loom. 
<P>	Should a long-distance call come up, it would be different, but not 
all that different.  Instead of connecting the call through your own local 
switchboard, you have to go up the hierarchy, onto the long-distance lines, 
known as "trunklines."  Depending on how far the call goes, it may have to 
work its way through a whole series of operators, which can take quite a 
while.   The caller doesn't wait on the line while this complex process is 
negotiated across the country by the gaggle of operators.   Instead, the 
caller hangs up, and you call him back yourself when the call has finally 
worked its way through. 
<P>	After four or five years of this work, you get married, and you have 
to quit your job, this being the natural order of womanhood in the 
American 1920s.  The phone company has to train somebody else -- 
maybe two people, since the phone system has grown somewhat in the 
meantime.  And this costs money. 
<P>	In fact, to use any kind of human being as a switching system is a 
very expensive proposition.   Eight thousand Leticia Luthors would be bad 
enough, but a quarter of a million of them is a military-scale proposition 
and makes drastic measures in automation financially worthwhile. 
<P>	Although the phone system continues to grow today, the number of 
human beings employed by telcos has been dropping steadily for years.  
Phone "operators" now deal with nothing but unusual contingencies, all 
routine operations having been shrugged off onto machines. Consequently, 
telephone operators are considerably less machine-like nowadays,  and 
have been known to have accents and actual character in their voices.  
When you reach a human operator today, the operators are rather more 
"human" than they were in Leticia's day -- but on the other hand, human 
beings in the phone system are much harder to reach in the first place. 
<P>	Over the first half of the twentieth century, "electromechanical" 
switching systems of growing complexity were cautiously introduced into 
the phone system.  In certain backwaters, some of these hybrid  systems 
are still in use.  But after 1965, the phone system began to go completely 
electronic, and this is by far the dominant mode today.  Electromechanical 
systems have "crossbars," and "brushes," and other large moving 
mechanical parts, which, while faster and cheaper than Leticia, are still 
slow, and tend to wear out fairly quickly. 
<P>	But fully electronic systems are inscribed on silicon chips, and are 
lightning-fast, very cheap, and quite durable.   They are much cheaper to 
maintain than even  the best electromechanical systems, and they fit into 
half the space.   And with every year, the silicon chip grows smaller, 
faster, and cheaper yet.  Best of all,  automated electronics work around 
the clock and don't have salaries or health insurance. 
<P>	There are, however, quite serious drawbacks to the use of 
computer-chips.   When they do break down, it is a daunting challenge to 
figure out what the heck has gone wrong with them.  A broken cordboard 
generally had a problem in it big enough to see.  A broken chip has 
invisible, microscopic faults.  And the faults in bad  software can be so 
subtle as to be practically theological. If you want a mechanical system to 
do something new, then you must travel to where it is, and pull pieces out 
of it, and wire in new pieces.  This costs money.  However, if you want a 
chip to do something new, all you have to do is change its software, which 
is easy, fast and dirt-cheap. You don't even have to see the chip to change 
its program. Even if you did see the chip, it wouldn't look like much.  A 
chip with program X doesn't look one whit different from a chip with 
program Y. With the proper codes and sequences, and access to 
specialized phone-lines, you can change electronic switching systems all 
over America from anywhere you please. 
<P>	And so can other people.  If they know how, and if they want to, 
they can sneak into a  microchip via the special phonelines and diddle with 
it, leaving no physical trace at all.  If they broke into the operator's station 
and held Leticia at gunpoint, that would be very obvious.  If they broke 
into a telco building and went after an electromechanical switch with a 
toolbelt, that would at least leave many traces.  But people can do all 
manner of amazing things to computer switches just by typing on a 
keyboard, and keyboards are everywhere today.  The extent of this 
vulnerability is deep, dark, broad, almost mind-boggling, and yet this is a 
basic, primal fact of life about any computer on a network. 
<P>	Security experts over the past twenty years have insisted, with 
growing urgency, that this basic vulnerability of computers represents an 
entirely new level of risk, of unknown but obviously dire potential to 
society.   And they are right. 
<P>	An electronic switching station does pretty much everything Letitia 
did, except in nanoseconds and on a much larger scale.  Compared to Miss 
Luthor's ten thousand jacks, even a primitive 1ESS switching computer, 
60s vintage,  has a 128,000 lines.   And the current AT&T system of 
choice is the monstrous fifth-generation 5ESS. 
<P>	An Electronic Switching Station can scan every line  on its "board" 
in a tenth of a second, and it does this over and over, tirelessly, around the 
clock.  Instead of eyes, it uses "ferrod scanners" to check the condition of 
local lines and trunks.  Instead of hands, it has "signal distributors," 
"central pulse distributors," "magnetic latching relays," and "reed 
switches," which complete and break the calls. Instead of a brain, it has a 
"central processor."   Instead of an instruction manual, it has a program.   
Instead of a handwritten logbook for recording and billing calls, it has 
magnetic tapes. And it never has to talk to anybody. Everything a customer 
might say to it is done by punching the direct-dial tone buttons on your 
subset.


<P>	Although an Electronic Switching Station can't talk, it does need an 
interface, some way to relate to its, er, employers.   This interface is known 
as the "master control center."  (This interface might be better known 
simply as "the interface," since it doesn't actually "control" phone calls 
directly.  However, a term like "Master Control Center" is just the kind of 
rhetoric that telco maintenance engineers  -- and hackers -- find 
particularly satisfying.) Using the master control center, a phone engineer 
can test local and trunk lines for malfunctions.  He (rarely she) can check 
various alarm displays, measure traffic on the lines, examine the records of 
telephone usage and the charges for those calls, and change the 
programming. 
<P>	And, of course, anybody else who gets into the master control 
center by remote control can also do these things, if he (rarely she) has 
managed to figure them out, or, more likely, has somehow swiped the 
knowledge from people who already know. 
<P>	In 1989 and 1990, one particular RBOC, BellSouth, which felt 
particularly troubled, spent a purported $1.2 million on computer security.   
Some think it spent as  much as two million, if you count all the associated 
costs. Two million dollars is still very little compared to the great cost-
saving utility of telephonic computer systems. 
<P>	Unfortunately, computers are also stupid.  Unlike human beings, 
computers  possess the truly profound stupidity of the inanimate. 
<P>	In the 1960s, in the first shocks of spreading computerization, there 
was much easy talk about the stupidity of computers -- how they could 
"only follow the program" and were rigidly required to do "only what they 
were told."   There has been rather less talk about the stupidity of 
computers since they began to achieve grandmaster status in chess 
tournaments, and to manifest many other impressive forms of apparent 
cleverness. 
<P>	Nevertheless, computers <I>still</I> are profoundly brittle and stupid; 
they are simply vastly more subtle in their stupidity and brittleness.   The 
computers of the 1990s are much more reliable in their components than 
earlier computer systems, but they are also called upon to do far more 
complex things, under far more challenging conditions. 
<P>	On a basic mathematical level, every single line of a software 
program offers a chance for some possible screwup.   Software does not sit 
still when it works; it "runs," it interacts with itself and with its own inputs 
and outputs. By analogy, it stretches like putty into millions of possible 
shapes and conditions, so many shapes that they can never all be 
successfully tested, not even in the lifespan of the universe.  Sometimes 
the putty snaps. 
<P>	The stuff we call "software" is not like anything that human society 
is used to thinking about.  Software is something like a machine, and 
something like mathematics, and something like language, and  something 
like thought, and art, and information....  but software is not in fact any of 
those other things.   The protean quality of software is one of the great 
sources of its fascination.  It also makes software very powerful, very 
subtle, very unpredictable, and very risky. 
<P>	Some software is bad and buggy.  Some is "robust," even 
"bulletproof."  The best software is that which has been tested by 
thousands of users under thousands of different conditions, over years.  It 
is then known as "stable."   This does <I>not</I> mean that the software is now 
flawless, free of bugs.  It generally means that there are plenty of bugs in 
it, but the bugs are well-identified and fairly well understood. 
<P>	There is simply no way to assure that software is free of flaws.  
Though software is mathematical in nature, it cannot by "proven" like a 
mathematical theorem; software is more like language, with inherent 
ambiguities, with different definitions, different assumptions, different 
levels of meaning that can conflict. 
<P>	Human beings can manage, more or less, with human language 
because we can catch the gist of it. 
<P>	Computers, despite years of effort in "artificial intelligence," have 
proven spectacularly bad in "catching the gist" of anything at all.  The 
tiniest bit of semantic grit may still bring the mightiest computer tumbling 
down. One of the most hazardous things you can do to a computer 
program is try to improve it -- to try to make it safer.  Software "patches" 
represent new, untried un"stable" software, which is by definition riskier. 
<P>	The modern telephone system has come to depend, utterly and 
irretrievably, upon software.  And the System Crash of January 15, 1990, 
was caused by an <I>improvement</I> in software.  Or rather, an <I>attempted</I> 
improvement. 
<P>	As it happened, the problem itself -- the problem per se  --  took 
this form.  A piece of telco software had been written in C language, a 
standard language of the telco field.  Within the C software was a long 
"do... while" construct.  The "do... while" construct contained a "switch" 
statement.  The "switch" statement contained an "if" clause.  The "if" 
clause contained a "break."  The "break" was <I>supposed</I> to "break" the "if 
clause."  Instead, the "break" broke the "switch" statement. 
<P>	That was the problem, the actual reason why people picking up 
phones on January 15, 1990, could not talk to one another. 
<P>	Or at least, that was the subtle, abstract, cyberspatial seed of the 
problem.  This is how the problem manifested itself from the realm of 
programming into the realm of real life. 
<P>	The System 7 software for AT&T's 4ESS switching station, the 
"Generic 44E14 Central Office Switch Software," had been extensively 
tested, and was considered very stable.   By the end of 1989, eighty of 
AT&T's switching systems nationwide had been programmed with the 
new software.  Cautiously, thirty four stations were left to run the slower, 
less-capable System 6, because AT&T suspected there might be 
shakedown problems with the new and unprecedently sophisticated 
System 7 network. 
<P>	The stations with System 7 were programmed to switch over to a 
backup net in case of any problems.  In mid-December 1989, however, a 
new high-velocity, high security software patch was distributed to each of 
the 4ESS switches that would enable them to switch over even more 
quickly, making the System 7 network that much more secure. 
<P>	Unfortunately, every one of these 4ESS switches was now in 
possession of a small but deadly flaw. 
<P>	In order to maintain the network, switches must monitor the 
condition of other switches -- whether they are up and running, whether 
they have temporarily shut down, whether they are overloaded and in need 
of assistance, and so forth.  The new software helped control this 
bookkeeping function by monitoring the status calls from other switches. 
<P>	It only takes four to six seconds for a troubled 4ESS switch to rid 
itself of all its calls, drop everything temporarily, and re-boot its software 
from scratch. Starting over from scratch will generally rid the switch of 
any software problems that may have developed in the course of running 
the system.   Bugs that arise will be simply wiped out by this process.  It is 
a clever idea. This process of automatically re-booting from scratch is 
known as the "normal fault recovery routine."   Since AT&T's software is 
in fact exceptionally stable, systems rarely have to go into "fault recovery" 
in the first place;  but AT&T has always boasted of its "real world" 
reliability, and this tactic is a belt-and-suspenders routine. 
<P>	The 4ESS switch used its new software to monitor its fellow 
switches as they recovered from faults.   As other switches came back on 
line after recovery, they would send their "OK" signals to the switch.   The 
switch would make a little note to that effect in its "status map," 
recognizing that the fellow switch was back and ready to go, and should be 
sent some calls and put back to regular work. 
<P>	Unfortunately, while it was busy bookkeeping with the status map, 
the tiny flaw in the brand-new software came into play.  The flaw caused 
the 4ESS switch to interacted, subtly but drastically, with incoming 
telephone calls from human users.  If -- and only if -- two incoming phone-
calls happened to hit the switch within a hundredth of a second,  then a 
small patch of data would be garbled by the flaw. 
<P>	But the switch had been programmed to monitor itself constantly 
for any possible damage to its data. When the switch perceived that its 
data had been somehow  garbled, then it too would go down, for swift 
repairs to its software.  It would signal its fellow switches not to send any 
more work.  It would go into the fault recovery mode for four to six 
seconds.  And then the switch would be fine again, and would send out its 
"OK, ready for work" signal. 
<P>	However, the "OK, ready for work" signal was the <I>very thing that 
had caused the   switch to go down in the first place.</I>  And <I>all</I> the 
System 7 switches had the same flaw in their status-map software.  As 
soon as they stopped to make  the bookkeeping note that their fellow 
switch was "OK," then they too would become vulnerable to the slight 
chance that two phone-calls would hit them within a hundredth of a 
second. 
<P>	At approximately 2:25 p.m. EST on Monday, January 15, one of 
AT&T's 4ESS toll switching systems in New York  City had an actual, 
legitimate, minor problem.  It went into fault recovery routines, announced 
"I'm going down," then announced, "I'm back, I'm OK."   And this cheery 
message then blasted throughout the network to many of its fellow 4ESS 
switches. Many of the switches, at first, completely escaped trouble.  
These lucky switches were not hit by the coincidence of two phone calls 
within a hundredth of a second.   Their software did not fail -- at first.  But 
three switches -- in Atlanta, St. Louis, and Detroit --  were unlucky, and 
were caught with their hands full.  And they went down.  And they came 
back up, almost immediately. And they too began to broadcast the lethal 
message that they, too, were "OK" again, activating the lurking software 
bug in yet other switches. 
<P>	As more and more switches did have that bit of bad luck and 
collapsed, the call-traffic became more and more densely packed in the 
remaining switches, which were groaning to keep up with the load.   And 
of course, as the calls became more densely packed, the switches were 
<I>much more likely</I> to be hit twice within a hundredth of a second. It only 
took four seconds for a switch to get well. There was no <I>physical</I> 
damage of any kind to the switches, after all.   Physically, they were 
working perfectly. This situation was "only" a software problem. But the 
4ESS switches were leaping up and down every four to six seconds, in a 
virulent spreading wave all over America,  in utter, manic, mechanical 
stupidity.  They kept <I>knocking</I>  one another down with their contagious 
"OK" messages. It took about ten minutes for the chain reaction to cripple 
the network.  Even then, switches would periodically luck-out and manage 
to resume their normal work.  Many calls -- millions of them -- were 
managing to get through.  But millions weren't. 
<P>	The switching stations that used System 6 were not directly 
affected.  Thanks to these old-fashioned switches, AT&T's national system 
avoided complete collapse.  This fact also made it clear to engineers that 
System 7 was at fault. 
<P>	Bell Labs engineers, working feverishly in New Jersey, Illinois, 
and Ohio, first tried their entire repertoire of standard network remedies on 
the malfunctioning System 7.  None of the remedies worked, of course, 
because nothing like this had ever happened to any phone system before. 
<P>	By cutting out the backup safety network entirely, they were able to 
reduce the frenzy of "OK" messages by about half.  The system then began 
to recover, as the chain reaction slowed.   By 11:30 pm on Monday 
January 15, sweating engineers on the midnight shift breathed a sigh of 
relief as the last switch cleared-up. 
<P>	By Tuesday they were pulling all the brand-new 4ESS software 
and replacing it with an earlier version of System 7. If these had been 
human operators, rather than computers at work, someone would simply 
have eventually stopped screaming.  It would have been <I>obvious</I> that the 
situation was not "OK," and common sense would have kicked in.   
Humans possess common  sense -- at least to some extent.   Computers 
simply don't. On the other hand, computers can handle hundreds of calls 
per second.  Humans simply can't.   If every single human being in 
America worked for the phone company, we couldn't match the 
performance of digital switches: direct-dialling, three-way calling, speed-
calling, callwaiting, Caller ID, all the rest of the cornucopia of digital 
bounty.   Replacing computers with operators is simply not an option any 
more. 
<P>	And yet we still, anachronistically,  expect humans to be running 
our phone system.   It is hard for us to understand that we have sacrificed 
huge amounts of initiative and control to senseless yet powerful machines. 
When the phones fail, we want somebody to be responsible.  We want 
somebody to blame. 
<P>	When the Crash of January 15 happened, the American populace 
was simply not prepared to  understand that enormous landslides in 
cyberspace, like the Crash itself, can happen, and can be nobody's fault in 
particular.   It was easier to believe, maybe even in some odd way more 
reassuring to believe, that some evil person,  or evil group, had done this 
to us.  "Hackers" had done it. With a virus.   A trojan horse.  A software 
bomb.  A dirty plot of some kind.   People believed this, responsible 
people.  In 1990, they were looking hard for evidence to confirm their 
heartfelt suspicions. 
<P>	And they would look in a lot of places. Come 1991, however, the 
outlines of an apparent new reality would begin to emerge from the fog. 
<P>	On July 1 and 2, 1991, computer-software collapses in telephone 
switching stations disrupted service in Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Los 
Angeles and San Francisco.   Once again, seemingly minor maintenance  
problems had crippled the digital System 7.  About twelve million people 
were affected in the Crash of July 1, 1991. 
<P>	Said the New York Times Service:  "Telephone company 
executives and federal regulators said they were not ruling out the 
possibility of sabotage by computer hackers, but most seemed to think the 
problems stemmed from some unknown defect in the software running the 
networks." 
<P>	And sure enough, within the week, a red-faced software company, 
DSC Communications Corporation of  Plano, Texas, owned up to 
"glitches" in the "signal transfer point" software that DSC had designed for 
Bell Atlantic and Pacific Bell.  The immediate cause of the July 1 Crash 
was a single mistyped character:  one tiny typographical flaw in one single 
line of the software.  One mistyped letter, in one single line, had deprived 
the nation's capital of phone service.  It was not particularly surprising that 
this tiny flaw had escaped attention: a typical System 7 station requires 
<I>ten million</I> lines of code. 
<P>	On Tuesday, September 17, 1991, came the most spectacular 
outage yet.   This case had nothing to do with software failures -- at least, 
not directly.  Instead, a group of AT&T's switching stations in New York 
City had simply run out of electrical power and shut down cold.  Their 
back-up batteries had failed.  Automatic warning systems were supposed 
to warn of the loss of battery power, but those automatic systems had 
failed as well. 
<P>	This time, Kennedy, La Guardia, and Newark airports all had their 
voice and data communications cut.   This horrifying event was 
particularly ironic, as attacks on airport computers by hackers had long 
been a standard nightmare scenario, much trumpeted by computer- 
security experts who feared the computer underground. There had even 
been a Hollywood thriller about sinister hackers ruining airport computers 
-- <I>Die Hard II.</I> 
<P>	Now AT&T itself had crippled airports with computer 
malfunctions  -- not just one airport, but three at once, some of the busiest 
in the world. 
<P>	Air traffic came to a standstill throughout the Greater New York 
area, causing more than 500 flights to be cancelled, in a spreading wave all 
over America and even into Europe.  Another 500 or so flights were 
delayed, affecting, all in all, about 85,000 passengers.  (One of these 
passengers was the chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission.) 
<P>	Stranded passengers in New York and New Jersey were further 
infuriated to discover that they could not even manage to make a long 
distance phone call, to explain their delay to loved ones or business 
associates. Thanks to the crash, about four and a half million domestic 
calls, and half a million international calls, failed to get through. The 
September 17 NYC Crash, unlike the previous ones, involved not a 
whisper of "hacker" misdeeds.  On the contrary,  by 1991, AT&T itself 
was suffering much of the vilification that had formerly been directed at 
hackers. Congressmen were grumbling.  So were state and federal 
regulators.  And so was the press. 
<P>	For their part, ancient rival MCI took out snide fullpage newspaper 
ads in New York, offering their own longdistance services for the "next 
time that AT&T goes down." "You wouldn't find a classy company like 
AT&T using such advertising," protested AT&T Chairman Robert Allen, 
unconvincingly.  Once again, out came the full-page AT&T apologies in 
newspapers, apologies for "an inexcusable culmination of both human and 
mechanical failure."   (This time, however, AT&T offered no discount on 
later calls.  Unkind critics suggested that AT&T were worried about 
setting any precedent for refunding the financial losses caused by 
telephone crashes.) 
<P>	Industry journals asked  publicly if AT&T was "asleep at the 
switch."   The telephone network, America's purported marvel of high-tech 
reliability,  had gone down three times in 18 months.  <I>Fortune</I> magazine 
listed the Crash of September 17 among the "Biggest Business Goofs of 
1991,"  cruelly parodying AT&T's ad campaign in an article entitled 
"AT&T Wants You Back (Safely On the Ground, God Willing)." 
<P>	Why had those New York switching systems simply run out of 
power?  Because no human being had attended to the alarm system.  Why 
did the alarm systems blare automatically, without any human being 
noticing? Because the three telco technicians who <I>should</I> have been 
listening were absent from their stations in the  power-room, on another 
floor of the building -- attending a training class.  A training class about 
the alarm systems for the power room! 
<P>	"Crashing the System" was no longer "unprecedented" by late 
1991.   On the contrary, it no longer even seemed an oddity.   By 1991, it 
was clear that all the policemen in the world could no longer "protect" the 
phone system from crashes.   By far the worst crashes the system had ever 
had, had been inflicted, by the system, upon <I>itself.</I>  And this time 
nobody was making cocksure statements that this was an anomaly, 
something that would never happen again.   By 1991 the System's 
defenders had met their nebulous Enemy, and the Enemy was -- the 
System.
