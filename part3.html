<h2>PART THREE:  Law and Order</h2>

<P> Of the various anti-hacker activities of 1990, "Operation Sundevil" had by far 
the highest public profile.   The sweeping, nationwide computer seizures of May 
8, 1990 were unprecedented in scope and highly, if rather selectively, publicized. 
<P>	Unlike the efforts of the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task 
Force,  "Operation Sundevil" was not intended to combat "hacking" in the sense 
of computer intrusion or sophisticated raids on telco switching stations.  Nor did 
it have anything to do with hacker misdeeds with AT&amp;T's software, or with 
Southern Bell's proprietary documents. 	
<P>	Instead, "Operation Sundevil" was a crackdown on those traditional 
scourges of the digital underground:  credit-card theft and telephone code abuse.   
The ambitious activities out of Chicago, and the somewhat lesser-known but  
vigorous antihacker actions of the New York State Police in 1990, were never a 
part of "Operation Sundevil" per se, which was based in Arizona.
<P>	Nevertheless, after the spectacular May 8 raids, the public, misled by  
police secrecy, hacker panic, and a puzzled national press-corps, conflated all 
aspects of the nationwide crackdown in 1990 under the blanket term "Operation 
Sundevil."  "Sundevil" is still the best-known synonym for the crackdown of 
1990.  But the Arizona organizers of "Sundevil" did not really deserve this 
reputation -- any more, for instance, than all hackers deserve a reputation as 
"hackers."
<P>	There was some justice in this confused perception, though.  For one 
thing, the confusion was abetted by the Washington office of the Secret Service, 
who responded to Freedom of Information Act requests on "Operation Sundevil" 
by referring investigators to the publicly known cases of Knight Lightning and 
the Atlanta Three.  And "Sundevil" was certainly the largest aspect of the 
Crackdown, the most deliberate and the best-organized.  As a crackdown on 
electronic fraud, "Sundevil" lacked the frantic pace of the war on the Legion of 
Doom; on the contrary, Sundevil's targets were picked out with cool deliberation 
over an elaborate investigation lasting two full years.
<P>	And once again the targets were bulletin board systems.
<P>	Boards can be powerful aids to organized fraud. Underground boards 
carry lively, extensive, detailed, and often quite flagrant "discussions" of 
lawbreaking techniques and lawbreaking activities. "Discussing" crime in the 
abstract, or "discussing" the particulars of criminal cases, is not illegal -- but 
there are stern state and federal laws against coldbloodedly conspiring in groups 
in order to commit crimes. 
<P>	In the eyes of police, people who actively conspire to break the law are 
not regarded as "clubs," "debating salons," "users' groups," or "free speech 
advocates."   Rather, such people tend to find themselves formally indicted by 
prosecutors as "gangs," "racketeers," "corrupt organizations" and "organized 
crime figures." 
<P>	What's more, the illicit data contained on outlaw boards goes well 
beyond mere acts of speech and/or possible criminal conspiracy.  As we have 
seen, it was common practice in the digital underground to post purloined 
telephone codes on boards, for any phreak or hacker who cared to abuse them.  
Is posting digital booty of this sort supposed to be protected by the First 
Amendment?  Hardly -though the issue, like most issues in cyberspace, is not 
entirely resolved.   Some theorists argue that to merely <I>recite</I> a number 
publicly is not illegal - only its <I>use</I> is illegal.   But anti-hacker police point out 
that magazines and newspapers (more traditional forms of free expression) never 
publish stolen telephone codes (even though this might well raise their 
circulation). 
<P>	Stolen credit card numbers, being riskier and more valuable, were less 
often publicly posted on boards -- but there is no question that some 
underground boards carried "carding" traffic, generally exchanged through 
private mail. 
<P>	Underground boards also carried handy programs for "scanning" 
telephone codes and  raiding credit card companies, as well as the usual 
obnoxious galaxy of pirated software, cracked passwords, blue-box schematics, 
intrusion manuals, anarchy files, porn files, and so forth. 
<P>	But besides their nuisance potential for the spread of illicit knowledge, 
bulletin boards have another vitally interesting aspect for the professional 
investigator.  Bulletin boards are cram-full of <I>evidence.</I>  All that busy trading 
of electronic mail, all those hacker boasts, brags and struts,  even the stolen 
codes and cards, can be neat, electronic, realtime recordings of criminal activity. 
As an investigator, when you seize a pirate board, you have scored a coup as 
effective as tapping phones or intercepting mail.  However, you have not 
actually tapped a phone or intercepted a letter.   The rules of evidence regarding 
phone-taps and mail interceptions are old, stern and wellunderstood by police, 
prosecutors and defense attorneys alike.  The rules of evidence regarding boards 
are new, waffling, and understood by nobody at all. 
<P>	Sundevil was the largest crackdown on boards in world history.  On May 
7, 8, and 9, 1990, about fortytwo computer systems were seized.  Of those forty-
two computers, about twenty-five actually were running boards.  (The vagueness 
of this estimate is attributable to the vagueness of (a) what a "computer system" 
is, and (b) what it actually means to "run a board" with one -- or with two 
computers, or with three.) 
<P>	About twenty-five boards vanished into police custody in May 1990.   As 
we have seen, there are an estimated 30,000 boards in America today.  If we 
assume that one board in a hundred is up to no good with codes and cards 
(which rather flatters the honesty of the board-using community), then that 
would leave 2,975 outlaw boards untouched by Sundevil.  Sundevil seized about 
one tenth of one percent of all computer bulletin boards in America. Seen 
objectively, this is something less than a comprehensive assault.   In 1990, 
Sundevil's organizers -- the team at the Phoenix Secret Service office, and the 
Arizona Attorney General's office -had a list of at least <I>three hundred</I> boards 
that they considered fully deserving of search and seizure warrants.   The twenty-
five boards actually seized were merely among the most obvious and  egregious 
of this much larger list of candidates.   All these boards had been examined 
beforehand -- either by informants, who had passed printouts to the Secret 
Service, or by Secret Service agents themselves, who not only come equipped 
with modems but know how to use them. 
<P>	There were a number of motives for Sundevil.  First, it offered a chance 
to get ahead of the curve on wire-fraud crimes.  Tracking back credit-card ripoffs 
to their perpetrators can be appallingly difficult.  If these miscreants have any 
kind of electronic sophistication, they can snarl their tracks through the phone 
network into a mind-boggling, untraceable mess, while still managing to "reach 
out and rob someone."  Boards, however, full of brags and boasts, codes and 
cards, offer evidence in the handy congealed form. 
<P>	Seizures themselves -- the mere physical removal of machines -- tends to 
take the pressure off.  During Sundevil, a large number of code kids, warez 
d00dz, and credit card thieves would be deprived of those boards -- their  means 
of community and conspiracy -- in one swift blow.  As for the sysops themselves 
(commonly among the  boldest offenders) they would be directly stripped of 
their computer equipment, and rendered digitally mute and blind. 
<P>	And this aspect of Sundevil was carried out with great success.   
Sundevil seems to have been a complete tactical surprise -- unlike the 
fragmentary and continuing seizures of the war on the Legion of Doom, 
Sundevil was precisely timed and utterly overwhelming.    At least forty 
"computers" were seized during May 7, 8 and 9, 1990, in Cincinnati, Detroit, 
Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, Phoenix, Tucson, Richmond, San Diego, San 
Jose, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.   Some cities saw multiple raids, such as the 
five separate raids in the New York City environs.  Plano, Texas (essentially a 
suburb of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, and a hub of the telecommunications 
industry)  saw four computer seizures.  Chicago, ever in the forefront, saw its 
own local Sundevil raid, briskly carried out by Secret Service agents Timothy 
Foley and Barbara Golden. 
<P>	Many of these raids occurred, not in the cities proper, but in associated 
white-middle class suburbs -- places like Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania and 
Clark Lake, Michigan.   There were a few raids on offices; most took place in 
people's homes, the classic hacker basements and bedrooms. 
<P>	The Sundevil raids were searches and seizures, not a group of mass 
arrests.  There were only four arrests during Sundevil.  "Tony the Trashman," a 
longtime teenage bete noire of the Arizona Racketeering unit, was arrested in 
Tucson on May 9. "Dr. Ripco," sysop of an outlaw board with the misfortune to 
exist in Chicago itself, was also arrested  -- on illegal weapons charges.   Local 
units also arrested a 19-year-old female phone phreak named "Electra" in 
Pennsylvania,  and a male juvenile in California.  Federal agents however were 
not seeking arrests, but computers. 
<P>	Hackers are generally not indicted (if at all) until the evidence in their 
seized computers is  evaluated -- a process that can take weeks, months -even 
years.    When hackers are arrested on the  spot, it's generally an arrest for other 
reasons.  Drugs and/or illegal weapons show up in a good third of anti-hacker 
computer seizures (though not during Sundevil). That scofflaw teenage hackers 
(or their parents) should have marijuana in their homes is probably not a 
shocking revelation, but the surprisingly common presence of illegal firearms in 
hacker dens is a bit disquieting.   A Personal Computer can be a great equalizer 
for the techno-cowboy -- much like that more traditional American "Great 
Equalizer," the Personal Sixgun.   Maybe it's not all that surprising that some 
guy obsessed with power  through illicit technology would also have a few illicit 
high-velocity-impact devices around.  An element of the digital underground 
particularly dotes on those "anarchy philes,"  and this element tends to shade into 
the crackpot milieu of survivalists, gun-nuts, anarcho-leftists and the ultra-
libertarian right-wing. 
<P>	This is not to say that hacker raids to date have uncovered any major 
crack-dens or illegal arsenals; but Secret Service agents do not regard "hackers" 
as "just kids."   They regard hackers as unpredictable people, bright and slippery.   
It doesn't help matters that the hacker himself has been "hiding behind his 
keyboard" all this time.   Commonly, police have no idea what he looks like.  
This makes him an unknown quantity, someone best treated with proper caution. 
<P>	To date, no hacker has come out shooting, though they do sometimes 
brag on boards that they will do just that.  Threats of this sort are taken seriously.   
Secret Service hacker raids tend to be swift, comprehensive, well-manned (even 
overmanned);  and agents generally burst through every door in the home at 
once, sometimes with drawn guns.  Any potential resistance is swiftly quelled. 
Hacker raids are usually raids on people's homes. It can be a very dangerous 
business to raid an American home; people can panic when strangers invade 
their sanctum.   Statistically speaking, the most dangerous thing a policeman can 
do is to enter someone's home.  (The second most dangerous thing is to stop a 
car in traffic.)  People have guns in their homes.   More cops are hurt in homes 
than are ever hurt in biker bars or massage parlors. 
<P>	But in any case, no one was hurt during Sundevil, or indeed during any 
part of the Hacker Crackdown. 
<P>	Nor were there any allegations of any physical mistreatment of a suspect.   
Guns were pointed, interrogations were sharp and prolonged; but no one in 1990 
claimed any act of brutality by any crackdown raider. 
<P>	In addition to the forty or so computers, Sundevil reaped floppy disks in 
particularly great abundance -- an estimated 23,000 of them, which naturally 
included every manner of illegitimate data:  pirated games, stolen codes, hot 
credit card numbers, the complete text and software of entire pirate bulletin-
boards.  These floppy disks, which remain in police custody today, offer a 
gigantic, almost embarrassingly rich source of possible  criminal indictments.  
These 23,000 floppy disks also include a thus-far unknown quantity of legitimate 
computer games, legitimate software,  purportedly "private" mail from boards, 
business records, and personal correspondence of all kinds. 
<P>	Standard computer-crime search warrants lay great emphasis on seizing 
written documents as well as computers -- specifically including photocopies, 
computer printouts, telephone bills, address books, logs, notes, memoranda and 
correspondence.  In practice, this has meant that diaries, gaming magazines, 
software documentation, nonfiction books on hacking and computer security, 
sometimes even science fiction novels, have all vanished out the door in police 
custody.   A wide variety of electronic items have been known to vanish as well, 
including telephones, televisions, answering machines, Sony Walkmans, desktop 
printers, compact disks, and audiotapes. 
<P>	No fewer than 150 members of the Secret Service were sent into the field 
during Sundevil. They were commonly accompanied by squads of  local and/or 
state police.   Most of these officers -especially  the locals -- had never been on 
an antihacker raid before.  (This was one good reason, in fact, why so many of 
them were invited along in the first place.)   Also, the presence of a uniformed 
police officer assures the raidees that the people entering their homes are, in fact, 
police.   Secret Service agents wear plain clothes.  So do the telco security 
experts who commonly accompany the Secret Service on raids (and who make 
no particular effort to identify themselves as mere employees of telephone 
companies). 
<P>	A typical hacker raid goes something like this. First, police storm in 
rapidly, through every entrance, with overwhelming force, in the  assumption 
that this tactic will keep casualties to a minimum.  Second, possible suspects are 
immediately removed from the vicinity of any and all computer systems, so that 
they will have no chance to purge or destroy computer evidence. Suspects are 
herded into a room without computers, commonly the living room,  and kept 
under guard -not <I>armed</I> guard, for the guns are swiftly holstered, but under 
guard nevertheless.   They are presented with the search warrant and warned that 
anything they say may be held against them. Commonly they have a great deal to 
say, especially if they are unsuspecting parents. 
<P>	Somewhere in the house is the "hot spot" -- a computer tied to a phone 
line (possibly several computers and several phones).   Commonly it's a 
teenager's bedroom, but it can be anywhere in the house; there may be several 
such rooms.   This "hot spot" is put in charge of a two-agent team, the "finder" 
and the "recorder."   The "finder" is computer-trained, commonly the case agent 
who has actually obtained the search warrant from a judge.   He or she 
understands what is being sought, and actually carries out the seizures: unplugs 
machines, opens drawers, desks, files, floppy-disk containers, etc.   The 
"recorder" photographs all the equipment, just as it stands -- especially the tangle 
of wired connections in the back, which can otherwise be a real nightmare to 
restore.  The recorder will also commonly photograph every room  in the house, 
lest some wily criminal claim that the police had robbed him during the search.   
Some recorders carry videocams or tape recorders; however, it's more common 
for the recorder to simply take written notes.  Objects are described and 
numbered as the finder seizes them, generally on standard preprinted police 
inventory forms. 
<P>	Even Secret Service agents were not, and are not, expert computer users.  
They have not made, and do not make, judgements on the fly about potential 
threats posed by various forms of equipment.   They may exercise discretion; 
they may leave Dad his computer, for instance, but they don't <I>have</I> to.   
Standard computer-crime search warrants, which date back to the early 80s, use 
a sweeping language that targets computers,  most anything attached to a 
computer, most anything used to operate a computer -- most anything that 
remotely resembles a computer -- plus most any and all written documents 
surrounding it. Computer-crime investigators have strongly urged agents to seize 
the works. 
<P>	In this sense, Operation Sundevil appears to have been a complete 
success.  Boards went down all over America, and were shipped en masse to the 
computer investigation lab of the Secret Service, in Washington DC, along with 
the 23,000 floppy disks and unknown quantities of printed material. 
<P>	But the seizure of twenty-five boards, and the multi-megabyte mountains 
of possibly useful evidence contained in these boards (and in their  owners' other 
computers, also out the door), were far from the only motives for Operation 
Sundevil.   An unprecedented action of great ambition and size, Sundevil's 
motives can only be described as  political.   It was a public-relations effort, 
meant to pass certain messages, meant to make certain situations clear:  both in 
the mind of the general public, and in the minds of various constituencies of the 
electronic community. 

<P>	First  -- and this motivation was vital -- a "message" would be sent from 
law enforcement to the digital underground.   This very message was recited in 
so many words by Garry M. Jenkins, the Assistant Director of the US Secret 
Service, at the Sundevil press conference in Phoenix on May 9,  1990, 
immediately after the raids.   In brief, hackers were mistaken in their foolish 
belief that they could hide behind the "relative anonymity of their computer 
terminals."  On the contrary, they should fully understand that state and federal 
cops were  actively patrolling the beat in cyberspace -- that they were on the 
watch everywhere, even in those sleazy and secretive dens of cybernetic vice, the 
underground boards. 
<P>	This is not an unusual message for police to publicly convey to crooks.   
The message is a standard message; only the context is new. In this respect,  the 
Sundevil raids were the digital equivalent of the standard vice-squad crackdown 
on massage parlors, porno bookstores, head-shops,  or floating crap-games.  
There may be  few or no arrests in a raid of this sort; no convictions, no trials, no 
interrogations.   In cases of this sort, police may well walk out the door with 
many pounds of sleazy magazines, X-rated videotapes, sex toys, gambling 
equipment, baggies of marijuana.... 
<P>	Of course, if something truly horrendous is discovered by the raiders, 
there will be arrests and prosecutions.   Far more likely, however, there will 
simply be a brief but sharp disruption of the closed and secretive world of the 
nogoodniks.  There will be "street hassle."  "Heat."  "Deterrence."  And, of 
course, the immediate loss of the seized goods.  It is  very unlikely that any of 
this seized material will ever be returned.   Whether charged or not, whether 
convicted or not, the perpetrators will almost surely lack the nerve ever to ask 
for this stuff to be given back. 
<P>	Arrests and trials -- putting people in jail -- may involve all kinds of 
formal legalities; but dealing with the justice system is far from the only task of 
police. Police do not simply arrest people.  They don't simply put people in jail.   
That is not how the police perceive their jobs.  Police "protect and serve." Police 
"keep the peace," they "keep public order." Like other forms of public relations, 
keeping public order is not an exact science.  Keeping public order is something 
of an art-form. 
<P>	If a group of tough-looking teenage hoodlums was loitering on a street-
corner, no one would be  surprised to see a street-cop arrive and sternly order 
them to "break it up."   On the contrary, the surprise would come if one of these 
ne'er-do-wells stepped briskly into a phone-booth, called a civil rights lawyer, 
and instituted a civil suit in defense of his Constitutional rights of free speech 
and free assembly.  But  something much  along this line was one of the many 
anomolous outcomes of the Hacker Crackdown. 
<P>	Sundevil also carried useful "messages" for other constituents of the 
electronic community. These messages may not have been read aloud from the 
Phoenix podium in front of the press corps, but there was little mistaking their 
meaning.  There was a message of reassurance for the primary victims of coding 
and carding:  the telcos, and the credit companies.  Sundevil was greeted with 
joy by the security officers of the electronic business community.   After years of 
high-tech harassment and spiralling revenue losses, their complaints of rampant 
outlawry were being taken seriously by law enforcement.  No more head-
scratching or dismissive shrugs; no more feeble excuses about  "lack of 
computer-trained officers" or the low priority of "victimless" white-collar 
telecommunication crimes. 
<P>	Computer-crime experts have long believed that computer-related 
offenses are drastically under-reported.   They regard this as a major open 
scandal of their field.  Some victims are reluctant to come forth, because they 
believe that police and prosecutors are not computer-literate, and can and will do 
nothing.  Others are embarrassed by their vulnerabilities, and will take strong 
measures to avoid any publicity; this is especially true of banks, who fear a loss 
of investor confidence should an embezzlement-case or wire-fraud surface.   
And some victims are so helplessly confused by their own high technology that 
they never even realize that a crime has occurred -- even when they have been 
fleeced to the bone. 
<P>	The results of this situation can be dire. Criminals escape apprehension 
and punishment. The computer-crime units that do exist, can't get work.   The 
true scope of computer-crime:  its size, its real nature, the scope of its threats, 
and the legal remedies for it -- all remain obscured. Another problem is very 
little publicized, but it is a cause of genuine concern.  Where there is persistent 
crime, but no effective police protection, then vigilantism can result.   Telcos, 
banks, credit companies, the major corporations who maintain extensive 
computer networks vulnerable to hacking -- these organizations are powerful, 
wealthy, and politically influential.   They are disinclined to be pushed around by 
crooks (or by most anyone else, for that matter).  They often maintain well-
organized private security forces, commonly run by experienced veterans of 
military and police units,  who have left public service for the greener pastures 
of the private sector.   For police, the corporate security manager can be a 
powerful ally; but if this gentleman finds no allies in the police, and the pressure 
is on from his board-of-directors, he may quietly take certain matters into his 
own hands. 
<P>	Nor is there any lack of disposable hired-help in the corporate security 
business.  Private security agencies -- the 'security business' generally -- grew 
explosively in the 1980s.  Today there are spooky gumshoed armies of "security 
consultants," "rent-acops," "private eyes,"  "outside experts" --  every manner of 
shady operator who retails in "results" and discretion.   Or course, many of these 
gentlemen and ladies may be  paragons of professional and moral rectitude.  But 
as anyone who has read a hard-boiled detective novel knows, police tend to be 
less than fond of this sort of private-sector competition. 
<P>	Companies in search of computer-security have  even been known to hire 
hackers.   Police shudder at this prospect. 
<P>	Police treasure good relations with the business community.   Rarely will 
you see a policeman so indiscreet as to  allege publicly that some major 
employer in his state or city has succumbed to paranoia and gone off the rails.  
Nevertheless, police -- and computer police in particular -- are aware of this 
possibility.   Computer-crime police can and do spend up to half of their 
business hours just doing public relations:  seminars, "dog and pony shows," 
sometimes with parents' groups or computer users, but generally with their core 
audience: the likely victims of hacking crimes.  These, of course, are telcos, 
credit card companies and large computerequipped corporations.   The police 
strongly urge these people, as good citizens, to report offenses and press criminal 
charges; they pass the message that there is someone in authority who cares, 
understands, and, best of all, will take useful action should a computer-crime 
occur. But reassuring talk is cheap.  Sundevil offered action. 
<P>	The final message of Sundevil was intended for internal consumption by 
law enforcement.  Sundevil was offered as proof that the community of 
American computer-crime police  had come of age. Sundevil was proof that 
enormous things like Sundevil itself could now be accomplished. Sundevil was 
proof that the Secret Service and its  local law-enforcement allies could act like a 
welloiled machine -- (despite the hampering use of  those scrambled phones).   It 
was also proof that the Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Unit  -the 
sparkplug of Sundevil -- ranked with the best in the world in ambition, 
organization, and sheer conceptual daring. 
<P>	And, as a final fillip, Sundevil was a message from the Secret Service to 
their longtime rivals in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  By Congressional 
fiat, both USSS and FBI formally share jurisdiction over federal computer-
crimebusting activities. Neither of these groups has ever been remotely happy 
with this muddled situation.  It seems to suggest that Congress cannot make up 
its mind as to which of these groups is better qualified.   And there is scarcely a 
G-man or a Special Agent anywhere without a very firm opinion on that topic.

<P>	For the neophyte, one of the most puzzling aspects of the crackdown on 
hackers is why the United States Secret Service has anything at all to do with 
this matter. 
<P>	The Secret Service is best known for its primary public role:  its agents 
protect the President of the United States.  They also guard the President's 
family, the Vice President and his family, former Presidents, and Presidential 
candidates.   They sometimes guard foreign dignitaries who are visiting the 
United States, especially foreign heads of state, and have been known to 
accompany American officials on diplomatic missions overseas. 
<P>	Special Agents of the Secret Service don't wear uniforms, but the Secret 
Service also has two uniformed police agencies.  There's the former White 
House Police  (now known as the Secret Service Uniformed Division, since they 
currently guard foreign embassies in Washington, as well as the White House 
itself).  And there's the uniformed Treasury Police Force. 
<P>	The Secret Service has been charged by Congress with a number of little-
known duties. They guard the precious metals in Treasury vaults. They guard the 
most valuable historical documents  of the United States:  originals of the 
Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln's Second Inaugural 
Address, an American-owned copy of the Magna Carta, and so forth.   Once they 
were assigned to guard the Mona Lisa, on her American tour in the 1960s. 
<P>	The entire Secret Service is a division of the Treasury Department.   
Secret Service Special Agents (there are about 1,900 of them)  are bodyguards 
for the President et al, but they all work for the Treasury.  And the Treasury 
(through its divisions of the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing) prints the nation's money. 
<P>	As Treasury police, the Secret Service guards the nation's currency; it is 
the only federal law enforcement agency with direct jurisdiction over 
counterfeiting and forgery.  It analyzes documents  for authenticity, and its fight 
against  fake cash is still quite lively (especially since the skilled counterfeiters 
of Medellin, Columbia have gotten into the act).   Government checks, bonds, 
and other obligations, which exist in untold millions and are worth untold 
billions, are common targets for forgery, which the Secret Service also battles.   
It even handles forgery of postage stamps. But cash is fading in importance 
today as money has become electronic.  As necessity beckoned, the Secret 
Service moved from fighting  the counterfeiting of paper currency and the 
forging of checks, to the protection of funds transferred by wire. 
<P>	From wire-fraud, it was a simple skip-and-jump to what is formally 
known as "access device fraud." Congress granted the Secret Service the 
authority to investigate "access device fraud"  under Title 18 of the United States 
Code (U.S.C.  Section 1029). 
<P>	The term "access device" seems intuitively simple.  It's some kind of 
high-tech gizmo you use to get money with.  It makes good sense to put this sort 
of thing in the charge of counterfeiting and wirefraud experts. 
<P>	However, in Section 1029, the term "access device" is very generously 
defined.  An access device is: "any card, plate, code, account number, or other 
means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another 
access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or 
that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds." 
<P>	"Access device" can therefore be construed to include credit cards 
themselves (a popular forgery item nowadays).  It also includes credit card 
account <I>numbers,</I> those standards of the digital underground.   The same goes 
for telephone charge cards (an increasingly popular item with telcos, who are 
tired of being robbed of pocket change by phone-booth thieves).   And also 
telephone access <I>codes,</I> those <I>other</I> standards of the digital underground.  
(Stolen telephone codes may not "obtain money," but they certainly do obtain 
valuable "services," which is specifically forbidden by Section 1029.) 
<P>	We can now see that Section 1029 already pits the United States Secret 
Service directly against the digital underground, without any mention at all of 
the word "computer." 
<P>	Standard phreaking devices, like "blue boxes," used to steal phone 
service from old-fashioned mechanical switches, are unquestionably  
"counterfeit access devices."   Thanks to Sec.1029, it is not only illegal to <I>use</I> 
counterfeit access devices, but it is even illegal to <I>build</I> them.   "Producing," 
"designing" "duplicating" or "assembling" blue boxes are all federal crimes 
today, and if you do this, the Secret Service has been charged by Congress to 
come after you. 
<P>	Automatic Teller Machines, which replicated all over America during the 
1980s, are definitely "access devices," too, and an attempt to tamper with their 
punch-in codes and plastic bank cards falls directly under Sec. 1029. 
<P>	Section 1029 is remarkably elastic.  Suppose you find a computer 
password in somebody's trash.  That password might be a "code" -- it's certainly 
a "means of account access."  Now suppose you log on to a computer and copy 
some software for yourself. You've certainly obtained "service" (computer 
service)  and a "thing of value" (the software). Suppose you tell a dozen friends 
about your swiped password, and let them use it, too.  Now you're "trafficking in 
unauthorized access devices."  And when the Prophet, a member of the Legion 
of Doom, passed a stolen telephone company document to Knight Lightning at 
<I>Phrack</I> magazine, they were both charged under Sec. 1029! 
<P>	There are two limitations on Section 1029.  First, the offense must 
"affect interstate or foreign commerce" in order to become a matter of federal 
jurisdiction.  The term "affecting commerce" is not well defined; but you may 
take it as a given that the Secret Service can take an interest if you've done most 
anything that happens to cross a state line. State and local police can be touchy 
about their jurisdictions, and can sometimes be mulish when the feds show up.   
But when it comes to computercrime, the local police are pathetically grateful 
for federal help -- in fact they complain that they can't get enough of it.   If you're 
stealing long-distance service, you're almost certainly crossing state lines, and 
you're definitely "affecting the interstate commerce" of the telcos.  And if you're 
abusing credit cards by ordering stuff out of glossy catalogs from, say, Vermont, 
you're in for it. The second limitation is money.  As a rule, the feds don't pursue 
penny-ante offenders.  Federal judges will dismiss cases that appear to waste 
their time.  Federal crimes must be serious;  Section 1029 specifies a minimum 
loss of a thousand dollars. We now come to the very next section of Title 18, 
which is Section 1030, "Fraud and related activity in connection with 
computers."  This statute gives the Secret Service direct jurisdiction over acts of 
computer intrusion.  On the face of it, the Secret Service would now seem to 
command the field. Section 1030, however, is nowhere near so ductile as 
Section 1029. The first annoyance is Section 1030(d), which reads: 
<P>	"(d) The United States Secret Service shall, <I>in addition to any other 
agency having such authority,</I> have the authority to investigate offenses under 
this section.  Such authority of the United States Secret Service shall be 
exercised in accordance with an agreement which shall be entered into by the 
Secretary  of the Treasury <I>and the Attorney General.</I>"   (Author's  italics.) 
<P>	The Secretary of the Treasury is the titular head of the Secret Service, 
while the Attorney General is in charge of the FBI.  In Section (d), Congress 
shrugged off responsibility for the computer-crime turf-battle between the 
Service and the Bureau, and made them fight it out all by themselves.  The result 
was a rather dire one for the Secret Service, for the FBI ended up with exclusive 
jurisdiction over computer break-ins having to do with national security, foreign 
espionage, federally insured banks, and U.S. military bases, while retaining joint 
jurisdiction over all the other computer intrusions. Essentially, when it comes to 
Section 1030, the FBI  not only gets the real glamor stuff for itself, but can peer 
over the shoulder of the Secret Service and barge in to meddle whenever it suits 
them. The second problem has to do with the dicey term "Federal interest 
computer."  Section 1030(a)(2) makes it illegal to "access a computer without 
authorization" if that computer belongs to a financial institution or an issuer of 
credit cards (fraud cases, in other words).   Congress was quite willing to give 
the Secret Service jurisdiction over money-transferring computers, but Congress 
balked at letting them investigate any and all computer intrusions.   Instead, the 
USSS had to settle for the money machines and the "Federal interest computers."   
A "Federal interest computer" is a computer which the government itself owns, 
or is using.  Large networks of interstate computers,  linked over state lines, are 
also considered to be of "Federal interest."   (This notion of "Federal interest" is 
legally rather foggy and has never been clearly defined in the courts.  The Secret 
Service has never yet had its hand slapped for investigating computer break-ins 
that were <I>not</I> of "Federal interest," but conceivably someday this might 
happen.) 
<P>	So the Secret Service's authority over "unauthorized access" to 
computers covers a lot of territory, but by no means the whole ball of 
cyberspatial wax.   If you are, for instance, a <I>local</I> computer retailer, or the 
owner of a <I>local</I> bulletin board system, then a malicious <I>local</I> intruder can 
break in, crash your system, trash your files and scatter viruses, and the U.S.  
Secret Service cannot do a single thing about it. 
<P>	At least, it can't do anything <I>directly.</I>   But the Secret Service will do 
plenty to help the local people who can. 
<P>	The FBI may have dealt itself an ace off the bottom of the deck when it 
comes to Section 1030; but that's not the whole story; that's not the street. What's 
Congress thinks is one thing, and Congress has been known to change its mind.  
The <I>real</I> turfstruggle is out there in the streets where it's happening.    If you're 
a local street-cop with a computer problem, the Secret Service wants you to 
know where you can find the real expertise.  While the Bureau crowd are off 
having their favorite shoes  polished -- (wing-tips) -- and making derisive fun of 
the Service's favorite shoes -- ("pansy-ass tassels") -the tassel-toting Secret 
Service has a crew of readyand-able  hacker-trackers installed in the capital of 
every state in the Union.   Need advice?  They'll give you advice, or at least point 
you in the right direction.  Need training?  They can see to that, too. 
<P>	If you're a local cop and you call in the FBI, the FBI (as is widely and 
slanderously rumored)  will order you around like a coolie, take all the credit for 
your busts, and mop up every possible scrap of reflected glory.  The Secret 
Service, on the other hand, doesn't brag a lot.  They're the quiet types. <I>Very</I> 
quiet.  Very cool.  Efficient.  High-tech. Mirrorshades, icy stares, radio ear-
plugs, an Uzi machine-pistol tucked somewhere in that well-cut jacket.  
American samurai, sworn to give their lives to protect our President.  "The 
granite agents." Trained in martial arts, absolutely fearless.  Every single one of 
'em has a top-secret security clearance. Something goes a little wrong, you're not 
gonna hear any whining and moaning and political buck- passing out of these 
guys. 
<P>	The facade of the granite agent is not, of course, the reality.  Secret 
Service agents are human beings. And the real glory in Service work is not in 
battling computer crime -- not yet, anyway -- but in protecting the President.  
The real glamour of Secret Service work is in the White House Detail.   If you're 
at the President's side, then the kids and the wife see you on television; you rub 
shoulders with the most powerful people in the world.   That's the real heart of 
Service work, the number one priority.  More than one computer investigation 
has stopped dead in the water when Service agents vanished at the President's 
need. 
<P>	There's romance in the work of the Service.  The intimate access to 
circles of great power;  the espritde-corps of a highly trained and disciplined 
elite; the high responsibility of defending the Chief Executive; the fulfillment of 
a patriotic duty.   And as police work goes, the pay's not bad.  But there's squalor 
in Service work, too.  You may get spat upon by protesters howling abuse -- and 
if they get violent, if they get too close, sometimes you have to knock one of 
them down -- discreetly. 
<P>	The real squalor in Service work is drudgery such as "the quarterlies," 
traipsing out four times a year, year in, year out, to interview the various pathetic 
wretches, many of them in prisons and asylums, who have seen fit to threaten the  
President's life.   And then there's the grinding stress of searching  all those faces 
in the endless bustling crowds, looking for hatred, looking for psychosis, looking 
for the tight, nervous face of an Arthur Bremer, a Squeaky Fromme, a Lee 
Harvey Oswald. It's watching all those grasping, waving hands for sudden 
movements, while your ears strain at your radio headphone for the long-
rehearsed cry of "Gun!" 
<P>	It's poring, in grinding detail, over the  biographies of every rotten loser 
who ever shot at a President.  It's the unsung work of the Protective Research 
Section, who study scrawled, anonymous death threats with all the meticulous 
tools of antiforgery techniques.


<P>	And it's maintaining the hefty computerized files on anyone who ever 
threatened the President's life.  Civil libertarians have become increasingly 
concerned at the Government's use of computer files to track American citizens -
- but the Secret  Service file of potential Presidential assassins, which has 
upward of twenty thousand names, rarely causes a peep of protest.  If you <I>ever</I> 
state that you intend to kill the President, the Secret Service will want to know 
and record who you are, where you are, what you are, and what you're up to.   If 
you're a serious threat -- if you're officially considered "of protective interest" -- 
then the Secret Service may  well keep tabs on you for the rest of your natural 
life. 
<P>	Protecting the President has first call on all the Service's resources.  But 
there's a lot more to the Service's traditions and history than standing guard 
outside the Oval Office. The Secret Service is the nation's oldest general federal 
law-enforcement agency.   Compared to the Secret Service, the FBI are new-
hires and the CIA are temps.  The Secret Service was founded 'way back in 
1865, at the suggestion of Hugh McCulloch, Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of the 
Treasury. McCulloch wanted a specialized Treasury police to combat 
counterfeiting.  Abraham Lincoln agreed that this seemed a good idea, and, with 
a terrible irony, Abraham Lincoln was shot that very night by John Wilkes 
Booth. 
<P>	The Secret Service originally had nothing to do with protecting 
Presidents.  They didn't take this on as a regular assignment until after the 
Garfield assassination in 1881.
<P>	And they didn't get any Congressional money for it until President 
McKinley was shot in 1901.   The Service was originally designed for one 
purpose: destroying counterfeiters. There are interesting parallels between the 
Service's nineteenth-century entry into counterfeiting, and America's twentieth-
century entry into computer-crime. 
<P>	In 1865, America's paper currency was a terrible muddle.  Security was 
drastically bad.  Currency was printed on the spot by local banks in literally 
hundreds of different designs.  No one really knew what the heck a dollar bill 
was supposed to look like.  Bogus bills passed easily.  If some joker told you that 
a one-dollar bill from the Railroad Bank of Lowell, Massachusetts had a woman 
leaning on a shield, with a locomotive, a cornucopia, a compass, various 
agricultural implements, a railroad bridge, and some factories, then you pretty 
much had to take his word for it.  (And in fact he was telling the truth!) 

<P>	<I>Sixteen hundred</I> local American banks designed and printed their own 
paper currency, and there were no general standards for security.  Like a badly 
guarded node in a computer network, badly designed bills were easy to fake, and  
posed a security hazard for the entire monetary system. 
<P>	No one knew the exact extent of the threat to the currency.  There were 
panicked estimates that as much as a third of the entire national currency was 
faked.  Counterfeiters -- known as "boodlers" in the underground slang of the 
time -- were  mostly technically skilled printers who had gone to the bad. Many 
had once worked printing legitimate currency. Boodlers operated in rings and 
gangs.   Technical experts engraved the bogus plates -- commonly in basements 
in New York City.  Smooth confidence men passed large wads of high-quality, 
highdenomination fakes, including the really sophisticated stuff --  government 
bonds, stock certificates, and railway shares.  Cheaper, botched fakes were sold 
or sharewared to low-level gangs of boodler wannabes.  (The really cheesy 
lowlife boodlers merely upgraded real bills by altering face values, changing 
ones to fives, tens to hundreds, and so on.) The techniques of boodling were 
little-known and regarded with a certain awe by the midnineteenth-century  
public.  The ability to manipulate the system for rip-off seemed diabolically 
clever.  As the skill and daring of the boodlers increased, the situation became 
intolerable.  The federal government stepped in, and began offering its own 
federal currency, which  was printed in fancy green ink, but only on the back - 
the original "greenbacks."  And at first, the improved security of the well-
designed, well-printed federal greenbacks seemed to solve the problem; but then 
the counterfeiters caught on.  Within a few years things were worse than ever:  a 
<I>centralized</I> system where <I>all</I> security was bad! 
<P>	The local police were helpless.  The Government tried offering blood 
money to potential  informants, but this met with little success.  Banks, plagued 
by boodling, gave up hope of police help and hired private security men instead.  
Merchants and bankers queued up by the thousands to buy  privately-printed 
manuals on currency security, slim little books like Laban Heath's  <I>Infallible 
Government Counterfeit Detector.</I>  The back of the book offered Laban Heath's 
patent microscope for five bucks. Then the Secret Service entered the picture. 
The first agents were a rough and ready crew.   Their chief was one William P. 
Wood, a former guerilla in the Mexican War who'd won a reputation busting 
contractor fraudsters for the War Department during the Civil War.   Wood, who 
was also Keeper of the Capital Prison, had a sideline as a counterfeiting expert, 
bagging boodlers for the federal bounty money. 
<P>	Wood was named Chief of the new Secret Service in July 1865.  There 
were only ten  Secret Service agents in all:  Wood himself, a handful who'd 
worked for him in the War Department, and a few former private investigators -- 
counterfeiting experts -- whom Wood had won over to public service.   (The 
Secret Service of 1865 was much the size of the Chicago Computer Fraud Task 
Force or the Arizona Racketeering Unit of 1990.)  These ten "Operatives" had an 
additional twenty or so "Assistant Operatives" and "Informants."   Besides salary 
and per diem, each Secret Service employee received a whopping twenty-five 
dollars for each boodler he captured. 
<P>	Wood himself publicly estimated that at least <I>half</I> of America's 
currency was counterfeit, a perhaps pardonable perception.   Within a year the  
Secret Service had arrested over 200 counterfeiters. They busted about two 
hundred boodlers a year for four years straight. 
<P>	Wood attributed his success to travelling fast and light, hitting the bad-
guys hard, and avoiding bureaucratic baggage.  "Because my raids were made 
without military escort and I did not ask the assistance of state officers, I 
surprised the professional counterfeiter." 
<P>	Wood's social message to the once-impudent  boodlers bore an eerie ring 
of Sundevil:  "It was also my purpose to convince such characters that it would 
no longer be healthy for them to ply their vocation without being handled 
roughly, a fact they soon discovered." 
<P>	William P. Wood, the Secret Service's guerilla pioneer, did not end well.  
He succumbed to the lure of aiming for the really big score.  The notorious 
Brockway Gang of New York City,  headed by William E. Brockway, the "King 
of the Counterfeiters," had forged a number of government bonds.  They'd 
passed these brilliant  fakes on the prestigious Wall Street investment firm of Jay 
Cooke and Company.  The Cooke firm were frantic and offered a huge reward 
for the forgers' plates. 
<P>	Laboring diligently, Wood confiscated the plates (though not Mr. 
Brockway) and claimed the reward.  But the Cooke company treacherously 
reneged.   Wood got involved in a down-and-dirty lawsuit with the Cooke 
capitalists.   Wood's boss, Secretary of the Treasury McCulloch, felt that Wood's 
demands for money and glory were unseemly, and even when the reward money 
finally came through, McCulloch refused to pay Wood anything.   Wood found 
himself mired in a seemingly endless round of federal suits and Congressional 
lobbying. 
<P>	Wood never got his money.  And he lost his job to boot.  He resigned in 
1869. 
<P>	Wood's agents suffered, too.  On May 12, 1869, the second Chief of the 
Secret Service took over, and almost immediately fired most of Wood's pioneer 
Secret Service agents:   Operatives, Assistants and Informants alike.  The 
practice of receiving $25 per crook was abolished.   And the Secret Service 
began the long, uncertain process of thorough professionalization.


<P>	Wood ended badly.  He must have felt stabbed in the back.  In fact his 
entire organization was mangled. 
<P>	On the other hand, William P. Wood <I>was</I> the first head of the Secret 
Service.  William Wood was the pioneer.  People still honor his name.  Who 
remembers the name of the <I>second</I> head of the Secret Service? 
<P>	As for William Brockway (also known as "Colonel Spencer"), he was 
finally arrested by the  Secret Service in 1880.  He did five years in prison, got 
out, and was still boodling at the age of seventyfour. 


<P>	Anyone with an interest in  Operation Sundevil - or in American 
computer-crime generally -- could scarcely miss the presence of Gail Thackeray, 
Assistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona. Computer-crime training 
manuals often cited Thackeray's group and her work;  she was the highest-
ranking state official to specialize in computer-related offenses.   Her name had 
been on the Sundevil press release (though modestly ranked  well after the local 
federal prosecuting attorney and the head of the Phoenix Secret Service office). 
As public commentary, and controversy, began to mount about the Hacker 
Crackdown, this Arizonan state official began to take a higher and higher public 
profile.  Though uttering almost nothing specific about the Sundevil operation 
itself, she coined some of the most striking soundbites of the growing 
propaganda war:  "Agents are operating in good faith, and I don't think you can 
say that for the hacker community," was one.  Another was the memorable "I am 
not a mad dog prosecutor" (<I>Houston Chronicle,</I>  Sept 2, 1990.)  In the 
meantime, the Secret Service maintained its usual extreme discretion; the 
Chicago Unit, smarting from the backlash of the Steve Jackson scandal, had 
gone completely to earth. 
<P>	As I collated my growing pile of newspaper clippings, Gail Thackeray 
ranked as a comparative fount of public knowledge on police operations. 
<P>	I decided that I  had to get to know Gail Thackeray.   I wrote to her at the 
Arizona Attorney General's Office.
<P>	Not only did she kindly reply to me, but, to my astonishment, she knew 
very well what "cyberpunk" science fiction was. 
<P>	Shortly after this, Gail Thackeray lost her job. And I temporarily 
misplaced my own career as a science-fiction writer, to become a full-time 
computer-crime journalist.   In early March, 1991, I flew to Phoenix, Arizona, to 
interview Gail Thackeray for my book on the hacker crackdown.
<P>	"Credit cards didn't used to cost anything to get," says Gail Thackeray.  
"Now they cost forty bucks -- and that's all just to cover the costs from <I>rip-off 
artists.</I>" 
<P>	Electronic nuisance criminals are parasites. One by one they're not much 
harm, no big deal.  But they never come just one by one. They come in swarms, 
heaps, legions, sometimes whole subcultures.  And they bite.  Every time we buy 
a  credit card today, we lose a little financial vitality to a particular species of 
bloodsucker. What, in her expert opinion, are the worst forms of electronic 
crime, I ask, consulting my notes.  Is it -credit card fraud?  Breaking into ATM 
bank machines?  Phone-phreaking?  Computer intrusions?  Software viruses?  
Access-code theft? Records tampering?  Software piracy?  Pornographic bulletin 
boards? Satellite TV piracy?  Theft of cable service?   It's a long list.  By the 
time I reach the end of it I feel rather depressed. "Oh no," says Gail Thackeray, 
leaning forward over the table, her whole body gone stiff with energetic 
indignation, "the biggest damage is telephone fraud.  Fake sweepstakes, fake 
charities. Boiler-room con operations.  You could pay off the national debt with 
what these guys steal....  They target old people, they get hold of credit ratings 
and demographics, they rip off the old and the weak." The words come tumbling 
out of her. 
<P>	It's low-tech stuff, your everyday boiler-room fraud.  Grifters, conning 
people out of money over the phone, have been around for decades.  This is 
where the word "phony" came from! 
<P>	It's just that it's so much <I>easier</I> now, horribly facilitated by advances in 
technology and the byzantine structure of the modern phone system. The same 
professional fraudsters do it over and over, Thackeray tells me, they hide behind 
dense onion-shells of fake companies.... fake holding corporations nine or ten 
layers deep, registered all over the map.  They get a phone installed under a false 
name in an empty safe-house.  And then they call-forward everything out of that 
phone to yet another phone,  a phone that may even be in another <I>state.</I>  And 
they don't even pay the charges on their phones; after a month or so, they just 
split.  Set up somewhere else in another Podunkville with the same seedy crew 
of veteran phone-crooks.  They buy or steal commercial credit card reports, slap 
them on the PC, have a program pick out people over sixty-five  who pay a lot to 
charities.  A whole subculture living off this, merciless folks on the con. 
<P>	"The 'light-bulbs for the blind' people,"  Thackeray muses, with a special 
loathing.  "There's just no end to them." 
<P>	We're sitting in a downtown diner in Phoenix, Arizona.  It's a tough 
town, Phoenix.  A state capital seeing some hard times.  Even to a Texan like 
myself, Arizona state politics seem rather baroque. There was, and remains, 
endless trouble over the Martin Luther King holiday, the sort of stiff-necked, 
foot-shooting incident for which Arizona politics seem famous.  There was Evan 
Mecham, the eccentric Republican millionaire governor who was impeached, 
after reducing state government to a ludicrous shambles.  Then there was the 
national Keating scandal, involving Arizona savings and loans, in which both  of 
Arizona's  U.S. senators, DeConcini and McCain, played sadly prominent roles. 
<P>	And the very latest is the bizarre AzScam case, in which state legislators 
were videotaped, eagerly taking cash from an informant of the Phoenix city 
police department, who was posing as a Vegas mobster. 
<P>	"Oh," says Thackeray cheerfully.  "These people are amateurs here, they 
thought they were finally  getting to play with the big boys.  They don't have the 
least idea how to take a bribe!  It's not institutional corruption.  It's not  like back 
in Philly." 
<P>	Gail Thackeray was a former prosecutor in Philadelphia.  Now she's a 
former assistant attorney general of the State of Arizona.  Since  moving to 
Arizona in 1986, she had worked under the aegis of Steve Twist,  her boss in the 
Attorney General's office.  Steve Twist wrote Arizona's pioneering computer 
crime laws and naturally took an interest in seeing them enforced. It was a snug 
niche, and Thackeray's Organized Crime and Racketeering Unit won a national 
reputation for ambition and technical knowledgeability....  Until the latest  
election in Arizona.  Thackeray's boss ran for the top job, and lost.  The victor, 
the new Attorney General, apparently went to some pains to eliminate the 
bureaucratic traces of his rival, including his pet group -- Thackeray's group.   
Twelve people got their walking papers. 
<P>	Now Thackeray's painstakingly assembled computer lab sits gathering 
dust somewhere in the glass-and-concrete Attorney General's HQ on 1275 
Washington Street.  Her computer-crime books, her painstakingly garnered back 
issues of phreak and hacker zines, all bought at her own expense -- are piled in 
boxes somewhere.  The State of Arizona is simply not particularly interested in 
electronic racketeering at the moment. 
<P>	At the moment of our interview, Gail Thackeray, officially unemployed, 
is working out of the county  sheriff's office, living on her savings, and 
prosecuting several cases -- working 60-hour weeks, just as always -- for no pay 
at all.  "I'm trying to train people," she mutters. 
<P>	Half her life seems to be spent training people - merely pointing out, to 
the naive and incredulous (such as myself) that this stuff is <I>actually going on 
out there.</I>  It's a small world, computer crime.  A young world.   Gail 
Thackeray, a trim blonde BabyBoomer who favors Grand Canyon white-water 
rafting to kill some slow time, is one of the world's most senior, most veteran 
"hacker-trackers."   Her mentor was Donn Parker,  the California think-tank 
theorist who got it all started 'way back in the mid70s, the "grandfather of the 
field,"  "the great bald eagle of computer crime." 
<P>	And what she has learned, Gail Thackeray teaches.  Endlessly. Tirelessly.  
To anybody.  To  Secret Service agents and state police, at the Glynco, Georgia 
federal training center.  To local police, on "roadshows" with her slide projector 
and notebook. To corporate security personnel.  To journalists.  To parents. 

<P>	Even <I>crooks</I> look to Gail Thackeray for advice. Phone-phreaks call her 
at the office.  They know very well who she is.  They pump her for information 
on what the cops are up to, how much they know. Sometimes whole <I>crowds</I> 
of phone phreaks, hanging out on illegal conference calls, will call Gail 
Thackeray up.  They taunt her.  And, as always, they boast.  Phone-phreaks, real 
stone phone-phreaks, simply <I>cannot shut up.</I>  They natter on for hours. 
<P>	Left to themselves, they mostly talk about the intricacies of ripping-off 
phones; it's about as interesting as listening to hot-rodders talk about suspension 
and distributor-caps.  They also gossip cruelly about each other.  And when 
talking to Gail Thackeray, they incriminate themselves.   "I have tapes," 
Thackeray says coolly. 
<P>	Phone phreaks just talk like crazy.  "Dial-Tone" out in Alabama has been 
known to spend half-an- hour simply reading stolen phone-codes aloud into 
voice-mail answering machines.  Hundreds, thousands of numbers, recited in a 
monotone, without a break -- an eerie phenomenon.  When arrested, it's a rare 
phone phreak who doesn't inform at endless length on everybody he knows. 
<P>	Hackers are no better.  What other group of criminals, she asks 
rhetorically, publishes newsletters and holds conventions?   She seems deeply 
nettled by the sheer brazenness of this  behavior, though to an outsider, this 
activity might make one wonder whether hackers should be considered 
"criminals" at all.  Skateboarders have magazines, and they trespass a lot.  Hot 
rod people have magazines and they break speed limits and sometimes kill 
people.... 
<P>	I ask her whether it would be any loss to society if phone phreaking and 
computer hacking, as hobbies, simply dried up and blew away, so that nobody 
ever did it again. She seems surprised.  "No," she says swiftly. "Maybe a little... 
in the old days... the MIT stuff...  But there's a lot of wonderful, legal stuff you 
can do with computers now, you don't have to break into somebody else's just to 
learn.  You don't have that excuse. You can learn all you like." Did you ever 
hack into a system? I ask.


<P>	The trainees do it at Glynco.  Just to demonstrate system vulnerabilities.  
She's cool to the notion.  Genuinely indifferent. "What kind of computer do you 
have?" 
<P>	"A Compaq 286LE," she mutters. 
<P>	"What kind do you <I>wish</I> you had?" 
<P>	At this question, the unmistakable light of true hackerdom flares in Gail 
Thackeray's eyes.  She becomes tense, animated, the words pour out:  "An 
Amiga 2000 with an IBM card and Mac emulation! The most common hacker 
machines are Amigas and Commodores.  And Apples."  If she had the Amiga, 
she enthuses, she could run a whole galaxy of seized computer-evidence disks 
on one convenient multifunctional machine.  A cheap one, too.  Not like the old 
Attorney General lab, where they had an ancient CP/M machine, assorted Amiga 
flavors and Apple flavors, a couple IBMS, all the utility software... but no 
Commodores.  The workstations down at the Attorney General's are Wang 
dedicated word-processors.  Lame machines  tied in to an office net --  though at 
least they get online to the Lexis and Westlaw legal data services. I don't say 
anything.  I recognize the syndrome, though.  This computer-fever has been 
running through segments of our society for years now.  It's a strange kind of 
lust: K-hunger, Meg-hunger; but it's a shared disease; it can kill parties dead, as 
conversation spirals into the deepest and most deviant recesses of software 
releases and expensive  peripherals....  The mark of the hacker beast.  I have it 
too.  The whole "electronic community," whatever  the hell that is, has it.  Gail 
Thackeray has it.  Gail Thackeray is a hacker cop.   My immediate reaction is a 
strong rush of indignant pity:  <I>why doesn't somebody buy this woman her 
Amiga?!</I>   It's not like she's asking for a Cray X-MP supercomputer mainframe; 
an Amiga's a sweet little  cookie-box thing.  We're losing zillions in organized 
fraud; prosecuting and defending a single hacker case in court can cost a 
hundred grand easy.  How come nobody can come up with four lousy grand so 
this woman can do her job?  For a hundred grand we could buy every computer 
cop in America an Amiga. There aren't that many of 'em. 
<P>	Computers.  The lust, the hunger, for computers.  The loyalty they 
inspire, the intense sense of possessiveness.   The culture they have bred.  I 
myself am sitting in  downtown Phoenix,  Arizona because it suddenly occurred 
to me that the police might -- just <I>might</I> -- come and take away my computer.  
The prospect of this, the mere <I>implied threat,</I>  was unbearable.  It literally 
changed my life.  It was changing the lives of many  others.  Eventually it would 
change everybody's life. 
<P>	Gail Thackeray was one of the top computercrime people in America.  
And I was just some novelist, and yet I had a better computer than hers. 
<I>Practically everybody I knew</I>  had a better computer than Gail Thackeray and 
her feeble  laptop 286.  It was like sending the sheriff in to clean up Dodge City 
and arming her with a slingshot cut from an old rubber tire. 
<P>	But then again, you don't need a howitzer to enforce the law.  You can do 
a lot just with a badge. With a badge alone, you can basically wreak havoc, take 
a terrible vengeance on wrongdoers.  Ninety percent of "computer crime 
investigation" is just "crime investigation:" names, places, dossiers, modus 
operandi, search warrants, victims, complainants, informants... 
<P>	What will computer crime look like in ten years?  Will it get better?  Did 
"Sundevil" send 'em reeling back in confusion? 
<P>	It'll be like it is now,  only worse, she tells me with perfect conviction.  
Still there in the background, ticking along, changing with the times:  the 
criminal underworld.  It'll be like drugs are.  Like our problems with alcohol.  
All the cops and laws in the world never solved our problems with alcohol.  If 
there's something people want, a certain percentage of them are just going to 
take it.  Fifteen percent of the populace will never steal.  Fifteen percent will 
steal most anything not nailed down.  The battle is for the hearts and minds of 
the remaining seventy percent. 
<P>	And criminals catch on fast.  If there's not "too steep a learning curve" -- 
if it doesn't require a baffling amount of expertise and practice -- then criminals 
are often some of the first through the gate of a new technology.  Especially if it 
helps them to hide.  They have tons of cash, criminals.  The new 
communications tech -- like pagers, cellular phones, faxes, Federal Express -- 
were pioneered by rich corporate people, and by criminals.  In the early years of 
pagers and beepers, dope dealers were so enthralled this technology that owing a 
beeper was practically prima facie evidence of cocaine dealing. CB radio 
exploded when the speed limit hit 55 and breaking the highway law became a 
national pastime.  Dope dealers send cash by  Federal Express, despite, or 
perhaps <I>because of,</I> the warnings in FedEx offices that tell you never to try 
this.  Fed Ex uses X-rays and dogs on their mail, to stop drug shipments.  That 
doesn't work very well. 
<P>	Drug dealers went wild over cellular phones. There are simple methods 
of faking ID on cellular phones, making the location of the call mobile, free of 
charge, and effectively untraceable.  Now victimized cellular companies 
routinely bring in vast toll-lists of calls to Colombia and Pakistan. 
<P>	Judge Greene's fragmentation of the phone company is driving law 
enforcement nuts.  Four thousand telecommunications companies.  Fraud 
skyrocketing.  Every temptation in the world available with a phone and a credit 
card number. Criminals untraceable.  A galaxy of "new neat rotten things to do."



<P>	If there were one thing Thackeray would like to have, it would be an 
effective legal end-run through this new fragmentation minefield. 


<P>	It would be a new form of electronic search warrant, an "electronic letter 
of marque" to be issued by a judge.  It would create a new category of 
"electronic emergency."   Like a wiretap, its use would be rare, but it would cut 
across state lines and force swift cooperation from all concerned.  Cellular, 
phone, laser, computer network, PBXes, AT&amp;T, Baby Bells, long-distance 
entrepreneurs, packet radio. Some document, some mighty court-order, that 
could slice through four thousand separate forms of corporate red-tape, and get 
her at once to the source of calls, the source of email threats and viruses, the 
sources of bomb threats, kidnapping threats.  "From now on," she says, "the 
Lindberg baby will always die." 
<P>	Something that would make the Net sit still, if only for a moment.  
Something that would get her up  to speed.  Seven league boots.  That's what she 
really needs.  "Those guys move in nanoseconds and I'm on the Pony Express." 
And then, too, there's the  coming international angle.  Electronic crime has 
never been easy to localize, to tie to a physical jurisdiction.  And phonephreaks 
and hackers loathe boundaries, they jump them whenever they can.  The English.  
The Dutch. And the Germans, especially the ubiquitous Chaos Computer Club.  
The Australians.  They've all learned phone-phreaking from America.  It's a 
growth mischief industry.  The multinational networks are global, but 
governments and the police simply aren't.  Neither are the laws.  Or the legal 
frameworks for citizen protection. 
<P>	One language is global, though -- English. Phone phreaks speak English; 
it's their native tongue even if they're Germans.  English may have  started in 
England but now it's the Net language; it might as well be called "CNNese." 
<P>	Asians just aren't much into phone phreaking. They're the world masters 
at organized software piracy.  The French aren't into phone-phreaking either.  
The French are into computerized industrial espionage. 
<P>	In the old days of the MIT righteous hackerdom, crashing systems didn't 
hurt anybody. Not all that much, anyway.  Not permanently.  Now the players 
are more venal.  Now the consequences are worse.  Hacking will begin killing 
people soon.  Already there are methods of stacking calls onto 911 systems, 
annoying the police, and possibly causing the death of some poor soul calling in 
with a genuine emergency.  Hackers in Amtrak computers, or airtraffic control 
computers, will kill somebody someday.  Maybe a lot of people.  Gail Thackeray 
expects it. 
<P>	And the viruses are getting nastier.  The "Scud" virus is the latest one 
out.  It wipes hard-disks. 
<P>	According to Thackeray, the idea that phonephreaks are Robin Hoods is 
a fraud.  They don't deserve this repute.   Basically, they pick on the weak.  
AT&amp;T now protects itself with the fearsome ANI (Automatic Number 
Identification) trace capability.  When AT&amp;T wised up and tightened  security 
generally, the phreaks drifted into the Baby Bells.  The Baby Bells lashed out in 
1989 and 1990, so the phreaks switched to smaller long-distance entrepreneurs.  
Today, they are moving into locally owned PBXes and voice-mail systems, 
which are full of security holes, dreadfully easy to hack.  These victims aren't the 
moneybags Sheriff of Nottingham or Bad King John, but small groups of 
innocent people who find it hard to protect themselves, and who really suffer 
from these depredations.  Phone  phreaks pick on the weak.  They do it for 
power.  If it were legal, they wouldn't do it.  They don't want service, or 
knowledge, they want the thrill of powertripping.   There's plenty of knowledge 
or service around, if you're willing to pay.  Phone phreaks don't  pay, they steal.  
It's because it is illegal that it feels like power, that it gratifies their vanity. 
<P>	I leave Gail Thackeray with a handshake at the door of her office 
building -- a vast InternationalStyle office building downtown.  The Sheriff's 
office is renting part of it.  I get the vague impression that quite a lot of the 
building is empty -- real estate crash. In a Phoenix sports apparel store, in a 
downtown mall, I meet the "Sun Devil" himself.  He is the cartoon mascot of 
Arizona State University, whose football stadium, "Sundevil," is near the local 
Secret Service HQ -- hence the name Operation Sundevil. The Sun Devil 
himself is named "Sparky."  Sparky the Sun Devil is maroon and bright yellow, 
the school colors.  Sparky brandishes a three-tined yellow pitchfork.  He has a 
small mustache, pointed ears, a barbed tail, and is dashing forward jabbing the 
air with the pitchfork, with an expression of devilish glee. 
<P>	Phoenix was the home of Operation Sundevil. The Legion of Doom ran a 
hacker bulletin board called "The Phoenix Project."  An Australian hacker 
named "Phoenix"  once burrowed through the Internet to attack Cliff Stoll, then 
bragged and boasted about it to <I>The New York Times.</I>  This net of 
coincidence is both odd and meaningless. 
<P>	The headquarters of the Arizona Attorney General, Gail Thackeray's 
former workplace, is on 1275 Washington Avenue.  Many of the downtown 
streets in Phoenix are named after prominent American presidents:  Washington, 
Jefferson, Madison.... 
<P>	After dark, all the employees go home to their suburbs.  Washington, 
Jefferson and Madison - what would be the Phoenix inner city, if there were an 
inner city in this sprawling automobile-bred town --  become the haunts of 
transients and derelicts. The homeless. The sidewalks along Washington are 
lined with orange trees.  Ripe fallen fruit lies scattered like croquet balls on the 
sidewalks and gutters.  No one seems to be eating them.  I try a fresh one.  It 
tastes unbearably bitter. 

<P>	The Attorney General's office, built in 1981 during the Babbitt 
administration,  is a long low twostory building of white cement and wall-sized 
sheets  of curtain-glass.  Behind each glass wall is a lawyer's office, quite open 
and visible to anyone strolling by. Across the street is a dour government 
building labelled simply ECONOMIC SECURITY, something that has not been 
in great supply in the American Southwest lately. 
<P>	The offices  are about twelve feet square.  They feature tall wooden cases 
full of red-spined lawbooks; Wang computer monitors; telephones; Post-it notes 
galore.  Also framed law diplomas and a general excess of bad Western 
landscape art.  Ansel Adams photos are a big favorite, perhaps to compensate for 
the dismal specter of the parking lot, two acres of striped black asphalt, which 
features gravel landscaping and some sickly-looking barrel cacti. 
<P>	It has grown dark.  Gail Thackeray has told me that the people who work 
late here, are afraid of muggings in the parking lot.  It seems cruelly ironic that a 
woman tracing electronic racketeers across the interstate labyrinth of Cyberspace 
should fear an assault by a homeless derelict in the parking lot of her own 
workplace. 
<P>	Perhaps this is less than coincidence.  Perhaps these two seemingly 
disparate worlds are somehow generating one another.  The poor and 
disenfranchised take to the streets, while the rich and computer-equipped, safe in 
their bedrooms,  chatter over their modems.  Quite often the derelicts kick the 
glass out and break in to the lawyers' offices, if they see something they need or 
want badly enough. I cross  the parking lot to the street behind the Attorney 
General's office.  A pair of young tramps are bedding down on flattened sheets 
of cardboard, under an alcove stretching over the sidewalk.  One tramp wears a 
glitter-covered T-shirt reading "CALIFORNIA" in Coca-Cola cursive.  His nose 
and cheeks look chafed and swollen; they glisten with what seems to be 
Vaseline.  The other tramp has a ragged long-sleeved shirt and lank brown hair 
parted in the middle. They both wear blue jeans coated in grime.  They are both 
drunk. "You guys crash here a lot?" I ask them. 
<P>	They look at me warily.  I am wearing black  jeans, a black pinstriped 
suit jacket and a black silk tie.  I have odd shoes and a funny haircut. 
<P>	"It's our first time here," says the red-nosed tramp unconvincingly. There 
is a lot of cardboard stacked here.  More than any two people could use.


<P>	"We usually stay at the Vinnie's down the street," says the brown-haired 
tramp, puffing a Marlboro with a meditative air, as he sprawls with his head on a 
blue nylon backpack.  "The Saint Vincent's." "You know who works in that 
building over there?"  I ask, pointing. The brown-haired tramp shrugs.  "Some 
kind of attorneys, it says." `
<P>	We urge one another to take it easy.  I give them five bucks. A block 
down the street I meet a vigorous workman who is wheeling along some kind of  
industrial trolley; it has what appears to be a tank of propane on it. 

<P>	We make eye contact.  We nod politely.  I walk past him.  "Hey!  Excuse 
me sir!" he says. 
<P>	"Yes?" I say, stopping and turning. 
<P>	"Have you seen," the guy says rapidly, "a black guy, about 6'7", scars on 
both his cheeks like this --" he gestures --  "wears a black baseball cap on 
backwards, wandering around here anyplace?" 
<P>	"Sounds like I don't much <I>want</I> to meet him," I say. 
<P>	"He took my wallet," says my new acquaintance. "Took it this morning.  
Y'know, some people would be <I>scared</I> of a guy like that.  But I'm not scared. 
I'm from Chicago.  I'm gonna hunt him down.  We do things like that in 
Chicago." 
<P>	"Yeah?" 
<P>	"I went to the cops and now he's got an APB out on his ass," he says with 
satisfaction.  "You run into him, you let me know." "Okay," I say.  "What is your 
name, sir?" 
<P>	"Stanley...." 
<P>	"And how can I reach you?" 
<P>	"Oh," Stanley says, in the same rapid voice, "you don't have to reach, uh, 
me.  You can just call the cops.  Go straight to the cops." He reaches into a 
pocket and pulls out a greasy piece of pasteboard. "See, here's my report on 
him." 
<P>	I look.  The "report," the size of an index card, is labelled PRO-ACT:  
Phoenix Residents Opposing Active Crime Threat.... or is it  Organized Against 
Crime Threat?  In the darkening street it's hard to read.  Some kind of vigilante 
group?  Neighborhood watch?  I feel very puzzled. 
<P>	"Are you a police officer, sir?"

<P>	He smiles, seems very pleased by the question. 
<P>	"No," he says. `
<P>	"But you are a 'Phoenix Resident?'" 
<P>	"Would you believe a homeless person," Stanley says. 
<P>	"Really?  But what's with the..."   For the first time I take a close look at 
Stanley's trolley.  It's a rubber-wheeled thing of industrial metal, but the device I 
had mistaken for a tank of propane is in fact a water-cooler.  Stanley also has an 
Army duffel-bag, stuffed tight as a sausage with clothing or perhaps a tent, and, 
at the base of his trolley, a cardboard box and a battered leather briefcase. 
<P>	"I see," I say, quite at a loss.  For the first time I notice that Stanley has a 
wallet.  He has not lost his wallet at all.  It is in his back pocket and chained to 
his belt.  It's not a new wallet.  It seems to have seen a lot of wear. 
<P>	"Well, you know how it is, brother," says Stanley. Now that I know that 
he is homeless -- <I>a possible threat</I> --  my entire perception of him has changed 
in an instant.   His speech, which once seemed just bright and enthusiastic, now 
seems to have a dangerous tang of mania.  "I have to do this!" he  assures me.  
"Track this guy down... It's a thing I do... you know... to keep myself together!"  
He smiles, nods, lifts his trolley by its decaying rubber handgrips. 
<P>	"Gotta work together, y'know, "  Stanley booms, his face alight with 
cheerfulness, "the police can't do everything!" 
<P>	The gentlemen I met in my stroll in downtown Phoenix are the only 
computer illiterates in this book.  To regard them as irrelevant, however, would 
be a grave mistake. 
<P>	As computerization spreads across society, the populace at large is 
subjected to wave after wave of future shock.  But, as a necessary converse, the 
"computer community" itself is subjected to wave after wave of incoming 
computer illiterates.   How will those currently enjoying America's digital 
bounty regard, and treat, all this teeming refuse yearning to breathe free?  Will 
the electronic frontier be another Land of Opportunity -- or an armed and 
monitored enclave, where the disenfranchised snuggle on their cardboard at the 
locked doors of our houses of justice? 
<P>	Some people just don't get along with computers.  They can't read.  They 
can't type.  They just don't have it in their heads to master arcane instructions in 
wirebound manuals.   Somewhere,  the process of computerization of the 
populace will reach a limit.  Some people -- quite decent people maybe, who 
might have thrived in any other situation -- will be left irretrievably outside the 
bounds.   What's to be done with these people, in the bright new shiny 
electroworld?  How will they be regarded, by the mouse-whizzing masters of 
cyberspace?  With contempt?  Indifference?  Fear? 
<P>	In retrospect, it astonishes me to realize how quickly poor Stanley 
became a  perceived threat.  Surprise and fear are closely allied feelings.  And 
the world of computing is full of surprises. 
<P>	I met one character in the streets of Phoenix whose role in those book is 
supremely and directly relevant.  That personage was Stanley's giant thieving 
scarred phantom.  This phantasm is everywhere in this book.  He is the specter 
haunting cyberspace. 
<P>	Sometimes he's a maniac vandal ready to smash the phone system for no 
sane reason at all. Sometimes he's a fascist fed, coldly programming  his mighty 
mainframes to destroy our Bill of Rights. Sometimes he's a telco bureaucrat, 
covertly conspiring to register all modems in the service of an Orwellian 
surveillance regime.   Mostly, though, this fearsome phantom is a "hacker."   
He's strange, he doesn't belong, he's not authorized, he doesn't smell right, he's 
not keeping his proper place, he's not one of us.  The focus of fear is the hacker, 
for much the same reasons that Stanley's fancied assailant is black. 
<P>	Stanley's demon can't go away, because he doesn't exist.  Despite 
singleminded and  tremendous effort, he can't be arrested, sued, jailed, or fired.  
The only constructive way to do <I>anything</I> about him is to learn more about 
Stanley himself. This learning process may be repellent, it may be ugly, it may 
involve grave elements of paranoiac confusion, but it's necessary.  Knowing 
Stanley requires something more than class-crossing condescension.  It requires 
more than steely legal objectivity.  It requires  human compassion and sympathy. 
To know Stanley is to know his demon.  If you know the other guy's demon, 
then maybe you'll come to know some of your own.   You'll be able to separate 
reality from illusion.   And then you won't do your cause, and yourself, more 
harm than good. Like poor damned Stanley from Chicago did.
<P>	The Federal Computer Investigations Committee (FCIC) is the most 
important and influential organization in the realm of American computer-crime.  
Since the police of other countries have largely taken their computer-crime cues 
from American methods, the FCIC might well be called the most important 
computer crime group in the world. 
<P>	It is also, by federal standards, an organization of great unorthodoxy.  
State and local investigators mix with federal agents.   Lawyers, financial 
auditors and computer-security programmers trade notes with street cops.  
Industry vendors and telco security people show up to explain their gadgetry and 
plead for protection and justice.   Private investigators, think-tank experts and 
industry pundits throw in  their two cents' worth.   The FCIC is the antithesis of a 
formal bureaucracy. Members of the FCIC are obscurely proud of this fact; they 
recognize their group as aberrant,  but are entirely convinced that this, for them, 
outright <I>weird</I> behavior is nevertheless <I>absolutely necessary</I> to get their 
jobs done. 
<P>	FCIC regulars  -- from the Secret Service, the FBI, the IRS, the 
Department of Labor, the offices of federal attorneys, state police, the Air Force, 
from military intelligence --  often attend meetings, held hither and thither across 
the country,  at their own expense.  The FCIC doesn't get grants.  It doesn't 
charge membership fees.  It doesn't have a boss.  It has no headquarters -- just a 
mail drop in Washington DC, at the Fraud Division of the Secret Service.  It 
doesn't have a budget.  It doesn't have schedules.  It meets three times a year -- 
sort of. Sometimes it issues publications, but the FCIC has no regular publisher,  
no treasurer, not even a secretary.   There are no minutes of FCIC  meetings. 
Non-federal people are considered "non-voting members,"  but there's not much 
in the way of elections.  There are no badges, lapel pins or  certificates of 
membership.   Everyone is on a firstname basis.   There are about forty of them.  
Nobody knows how many, exactly.  People come, people go -sometimes people 
"go" formally but still hang around anyway.  Nobody has ever exactly figured 
out what "membership" of this "Committee" actually entails. 
<P>	Strange as this may seem to some, to anyone familiar with the social 
world of computing, the "organization" of the FCIC is very recognizable. 

<P>	For years now, economists and management theorists have speculated 
that the tidal wave of the information revolution would destroy rigid, pyramidal 
bureaucracies, where everything is topdown and centrally controlled.   Highly 
trained "employees" would take on much greater autonomy, being self-starting, 
and self-motivating,  moving from place to place, task to task, with great speed  
and fluidity.  "Ad-hocracy" would rule, with groups of people spontaneously 
knitting together across organizational lines, tackling the problem at hand, 
applying intense computer-aided expertise to it, and then vanishing whence they 
came. 
<P>	This is more or less what has actually happened in the world of federal 
computer investigation.  With the conspicuous exception of the phone 
companies, which are after all over a hundred years old, practically <I>every</I> 
organization that plays any important role in this book functions just like the 
FCIC.    The Chicago Task Force, the Arizona Racketeering Unit, the Legion of 
Doom, the Phrack crowd, the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- they <I>all</I> look 
and act like "tiger teams" or "user's groups."  They are all electronic ad-hocracies 
leaping up spontaneously to attempt to meet a need. 

<P>	Some are police.  Some are, by strict definition, criminals.  Some are 
political interest-groups.   But every single group has that same quality of 
apparent spontaneity -- "Hey, gang!  My uncle's got a barn -let's put on a show!" 
<P>	Every one of these groups is embarrassed by this "amateurism," and, for 
the sake of their public image in a world of non-computer people,  they all 
attempt to look as stern and formal and impressive as possible.    These 
electronic frontier-dwellers resemble groups of nineteenth-century pioneers 
hankering after the respectability of statehood. There are however,  two crucial 
differences in the historical experience of these "pioneers" of the nineteeth and 
twenty-first centuries. 


<P>	First, powerful information technology <I>does</I>  play into the hands of 
small, fluid, loosely organized groups.  There have always been "pioneers," 
"hobbyists," "amateurs," "dilettantes," "volunteers," "movements," "users' 
groups" and "blue-ribbon panels of experts" around.   But a group of this kind - 
when technically equipped to ship huge amounts of specialized information, at 
lightning speed, to its members, to government, and to the press -- is simply a 
different kind of animal.   It's like the difference between an eel and an electric 
eel. 
<P>	The second crucial change is that American society is currently in a state  
approaching permanent technological revolution.  In the world of  computers 
particularly,  it is practically impossible to <I>ever</I> stop being a  "pioneer," unless 
you either drop dead or deliberately jump off the bus.  The scene has never 
slowed down enough to become well-institutionalized.  And after twenty, thirty, 
forty years the "computer revolution" continues to spread, to permeate new 
corners of society.   Anything that really works is already obsolete. 
<P>	If you spend your entire working life as a "pioneer," the word "pioneer" 
begins to lose its meaning.  Your way of life looks less and less like an 
introduction to "something else" more stable and organized,  and more and more 
like <I>just the way things are.</I>   A "permanent revolution" is really a 
contradiction in terms.  If "turmoil"  lasts long enough, it simply becomes <I>a 
new kind of society</I>  -still the same game of history, but new players, new rules. 
Apply this to the world of late twentieth-century law enforcement, and the 
implications are  novel and puzzling indeed.  Any bureaucratic rulebook you 
write about computer-crime will be flawed when you write it, and almost an 
antique by the time it sees print.   The fluidity and fast reactions of the FCIC 
give them a great advantage in this regard,  which explains their success.  Even 
with the best will in the world (which it does not, in fact, possess) it is 
impossible for an organization the size of the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to get up to speed on the theory and practice of computer crime.   If  
they tried to train all their agents to do this, it would be <I>suicidal,</I>  as they 
would <I>never be able to do anything else.</I> 

<P>	The FBI does try to train its agents in the basics of electronic crime, at 
their base in Quantico, Virginia.   And the Secret Service, along with many other 
law enforcement groups, runs quite successful and well-attended training 
courses on wire fraud, business crime, and computer intrusion  at the Federal 
Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC, pronounced "fletsy") in Glynco, 
Georgia.   But the best efforts of these bureaucracies does not remove the 
absolute need for a "cutting-edge mess" like the FCIC. 
<P>	For you see -- the members of FCIC <I>are</I> the trainers of the rest of law 
enforcement.  Practically and literally speaking, they are the Glynco computer-
crime faculty by another name.  If the FCIC went over a cliff on a bus, the U.S. 
law enforcement community would be rendered deaf dumb and blind in the 
world of computer crime, and would swiftly feel a desperate need to reinvent 
them. And this is no time to go starting from scratch. 
<P>	On June 11, 1991, I once again arrived in Phoenix, Arizona, for the latest 
meeting of the Federal Computer Investigations Committee.  This  was more or 
less the twentieth meeting of this stellar group.   The count was uncertain, since 
nobody could figure out whether to include the meetings of "the Colluquy," 
which is what the FCIC was called in the mid-1980s before it had even managed 
to obtain the dignity of its own acronym. 
<P>	Since my last visit to Arizona, in May, the local AzScam bribery scandal 
had resolved itself in a general muddle of humiliation.  The Phoenix chief of 
police, whose agents had videotaped nine state  legislators up to no good, had 
resigned his office in a tussle with the Phoenix city council over the propriety of 
his undercover operations. 
<P>	The Phoenix Chief could now join Gail Thackeray and eleven of her 
closest associates in the shared experience of politically motivated 
unemployment.   As of June, resignations were still continuing at the Arizona 
Attorney General's office, which could be interpreted as either a New Broom 
Sweeping Clean or a Night of the Long Knives Part II, depending on your point 
of view. 
<P>	The meeting of FCIC was held at the Scottsdale Hilton Resort. Scottsdale 
is a wealthy suburb of Phoenix, known as "Scottsdull" to scoffing local trendies, 
but well-equipped with posh shoppingmalls and manicured lawns, while 
conspicuously undersupplied with homeless derelicts.   The Scottsdale Hilton 
Resort was a sprawling hotel in postmodern  crypto-Southwestern style.  It 
featured a "mission bell tower" plated in turquoise tile and vaguely resembling a 
Saudi minaret. 
<P>	Inside it was all barbarically striped Santa Fe Style decor.   There was a 
health spa downstairs and a large oddly-shaped pool in the patio.  A poolside 
umbrella-stand offered Ben and Jerry's politically correct Peace Pops. 
<P>	I registered as a member of FCIC, attaining a handy discount rate, then 
went in search of the Feds. Sure enough, at the back of the hotel grounds came 
the unmistakable sound of Gail Thackeray holding forth. 
<P>	Since I had also attended the Computers Freedom and Privacy 
conference (about which more later), this was the second time I had seen 
Thackeray in a group of her law enforcement colleagues.   Once again I was 
struck by how simply pleased they seemed to see her.   It was natural that she'd 
get <I>some</I> attention, as Gail was one of two women in a group of some thirty 
men; but there was a lot more to it than that. 
<P>	Gail Thackeray personifies the social glue of the FCIC.  They could give 
a damn about her losing her job with the Attorney General.  They were sorry  
about it, of course, but hell, they'd all lost jobs.   If they were the kind of guys 
who liked steady  boring jobs, they would never have gotten into computer work 
in the first place. 
<P>	I wandered into her circle and was immediately introduced to five 
strangers.  The conditions of my visit at FCIC were reviewed.  I would not quote 
anyone directly.  I would not tie opinions expressed to the agencies of the 
attendees.  I would not (a purely hypothetical example) report the conversation 
of a guy from the Secret Service talking quite civilly to  a guy from the FBI, as 
these two agencies <I>never</I>  talk to each other, and the IRS (also present, also 
hypothetical) <I>never talks to anybody.</I> 
<P>	Worse yet, I was forbidden to attend the first conference.  And I didn't.  I 
have no idea what the FCIC was up to behind closed doors that afternoon. I 
rather suspect that they were engaging in a frank and thorough confession of 
their errors, goof-ups and blunders, as this has been a feature of every FCIC 
meeting since their legendary Memphis beer bust of 1986.  Perhaps the single 
greatest attraction of FCIC is that it is a place where you can go, let your hair 
down, and completely level with people who actually comprehend what you are 
talking about. Not only do they understand you, but they <I>really pay attention,</I>  
they are <I>grateful for your insights,</I> and they <I>forgive you,</I>  which in nine 
cases out of ten is something even your boss can't do, because as soon as you 
start talking "ROM," "BBS," or "T-1 trunk," his eyes glaze over. I had nothing 
much to do that afternoon.  The FCIC were beavering away in their  conference 
room.  Doors were firmly closed, windows too dark to peer through.  I wondered 
what a real hacker, a computer intruder, would do at a meeting like this. 
<P>	The answer came at once.  He would "trash" the place.  Not reduce the 
place to trash  in some orgy of vandalism; that's not the use of the term in the 
hacker milieu.  No, he would quietly <I>empty the trash baskets</I> and silently raid 
any valuable data indiscreetly thrown away. 
<P>	Journalists have been known to do this. (Journalists hunting information 
have been known to do almost every single unethical thing that hackers have 
ever done.  They also throw in a few awful techniques all their own.)  The 
legality of 'trashing' is somewhat dubious but it is not in fact flagrantly illegal.   
It was, however, absurd to contemplate trashing the FCIC.  These people knew  
all about trashing.   I wouldn't last fifteen seconds. 
<P>	The idea sounded interesting, though.   I'd been hearing a lot about the 
practice lately.  On the spur of the moment, I decided I would try trashing the 
office <I>across the hall</I>  from the FCIC, an area which had nothing to do with 
the investigators. 
<P>	The office was tiny; six chairs, a table.... Nevertheless, it was open, so I 
dug around in its plastic trash can. 
<P>	To my utter astonishment, I came up with the torn scraps of a SPRINT 
long-distance phone bill. More digging produced a bank statement and the 
scraps of a hand-written letter, along with gum, cigarette ashes, candy wrappers 
and a day-old-issue of USA TODAY. 
<P>	The trash went back in its receptacle while the scraps of data went into  
my travel bag.  I detoured through the hotel souvenir shop for some Scotch tape 
and went up to my room. 
<P>	Coincidence or not, it was quite true.  Some poor soul had, in fact, 
thrown a SPRINT bill into the hotel's trash.   Date May 1991, total amount due: 
$252.36.  Not a business phone, either, but a residential bill, in the name of 
someone called Evelyn (not her real name).  Evelyn's records showed a <B>past 
due bill</B>!   Here was her nine-digit account ID.    Here was a stern 
computer-printed warning:  "TREAT YOUR FONCARD AS YOU WOULD 
ANY CREDIT CARD.  TO SECURE AGAINST FRAUD, NEVER GIVE 
YOUR FONCARD NUMBER OVER THE PHONE UNLESS YOU 
INITIATED THE CALL.  IF YOU RECEIVE SUSPICIOUS CALLS PLEASE 
NOTIFY CUSTOMER SERVICE IMMEDIATELY!" 
<P>	I examined my watch.  Still plenty of time left for the FCIC to carry on.  I 
sorted out the scraps of Evelyn's SPRINT bill and re-assembled them with fresh 
Scotch tape.  Here was her ten-digit FONCARD number.   Didn't seem to have 
the ID number necessary to cause real fraud trouble. 
<P>	I did, however, have Evelyn's home phone number.  And the phone 
numbers for a whole crowd of Evelyn's long-distance friends and acquaintances. 
In San Diego, Folsom, Redondo, Las Vegas, La Jolla, Topeka, and Northampton 
Massachusetts.  Even somebody in Australia! 
<P>	I examined other documents.  Here was a bank statement.  It was 
Evelyn's IRA account down at a bank in San Mateo California (total balance 
$1877.20).  Here was a charge-card bill for $382.64. She was paying it off bit by 
bit. 
<P>	Driven by motives that were completely unethical and prurient, I now 
examined the handwritten notes.  They had been torn fairly thoroughly, so much 
so that it took me almost an entire five minutes to reassemble them. 
<P>	They were drafts of a love letter.  They had been written on the lined 
stationery of Evelyn's employer, a biomedical company.  Probably written at 
work when she should have been doing something else. 
<P>	"Dear Bob," (not his real name)  "I guess in everyone's life there comes a 
time when hard  decisions have to be made, and this is a difficult one for me -- 
very upsetting.  Since you haven't called me, and I don't understand why, I can 
only surmise it's because you don't want to.  I thought I would have heard from 
you Friday.  I did have a few unusual problems with my phone and possibly you 
tried, I hope so. 
<P>	"Robert, you asked me to 'let go'..." 
<P>	The first note ended.  <I>Unusual problems with her phone?</I>  I looked 
swiftly at the next note. "Bob, not hearing from you for the whole weekend has 
left me very perplexed..." 

<P>	Next draft. "Dear Bob, there is so much I don't understand right now, and 
I wish I did.  I wish I could talk to you, but for some unknown reason you have 
elected not to call -- this is so difficult for me to understand..." 
<P>	She tried again. 
<P>	"Bob, Since I have always held you in such high esteem, I had every 
hope that we could remain good friends, but now one essential ingredient is 
missing - respect.  Your ability to discard people when their purpose is served is 
appalling to me.  The kindest thing you could do for me now is to leave me 
alone. You are no longer welcome in my heart or home..." 
<P>	Try again. 
<P>	"Bob, I wrote a very factual note to you to say how much respect I had 
lost for you, by the way you treat people, me in particular, so uncaring and cold. 
The kindest thing you can do for me is to leave me alone entirely, as you are no 
longer welcome in my heart or home. I would appreciate it if you could retire 
your debt to me as soon as possible -- I wish no link to you in any way.  
Sincerely, Evelyn."

<P>	Good heavens, I thought, the bastard actually owes her money!  I turned 
to the next page. 
<P>	"Bob:  very simple.  GOODBYE!  No more mind games -- no more 
fascination -- no more coldness -no more respect for you!  It's over -- Finis.  
Evie" 
<P>	There were two versions of the final brushoff letter, but they read about 
the same.  Maybe she hadn't sent it.  The final item in my illicit and shameful 
booty was an envelope addressed to "Bob"  at his home address, but it had no 
stamp on it and it hadn't been mailed. 
<P>	Maybe she'd just been blowing off steam because her rascal boyfriend 
had neglected to call her one weekend.   Big deal.  Maybe they'd kissed and 
made up, maybe she and Bob were down at Pop's Chocolate Shop now, sharing 
a malted.  Sure. 
<P>	Easy to find out.  All I had to do was call Evelyn up.  With a half-clever 
story and enough brass- plated gall I could probably trick the truth out of her. 
Phone-phreaks and hackers deceive people over the phone all the time.  It's 
called "social engineering." Social engineering is a very common practice in the 
underground, and almost magically effective. Human beings are almost always 
the weakest link in computer security.  The simplest way to learn Things You 
Are Not Meant To Know is simply to call up and exploit the knowledgeable 
people.   With social engineering, you use the bits of specialized knowledge you 
already have as a key, to manipulate people into believing that you are 
legitimate.  You  can then coax, flatter, or frighten them into revealing almost 
anything you want to know.  Deceiving people (especially over the phone) is 
easy and fun. Exploiting their gullibility is very gratifying; it makes you feel very 
superior to them. If I'd been a  malicious hacker on a trashing raid, I would now 
have Evelyn very much in my power.  Given all this inside  data, it wouldn't take 
much effort at all to invent a convincing lie.  If I were ruthless enough, and jaded 
enough, and clever enough, this momentary indiscretion of hers -maybe 
committed in tears, who knows -- could cause her a whole world of confusion 
and grief. 
<P>	I didn't even have to have a <I>malicious</I>  motive. Maybe I'd be "on her 
side," and call up Bob instead, and anonymously threaten to break both his 
kneecaps if he didn't take Evelyn out for a steak dinner pronto.   It was still 
profoundly <I>none of my business.</I>   To have gotten this knowledge at all was  a 
sordid act and to use it would be to inflict a sordid injury. 
<P>	To do all these awful things would require exactly zero high-tech 
expertise.  All it would take was the willingness to do it and a certain amount of 
bent imagination. I went back downstairs. The hard-working FCIC, who had 
labored forty-five minutes over their schedule, were through for the day, and 
adjourned to the hotel bar.  We all had a beer. 

<P>	I had a chat with a guy about "Isis," or rather IACIS, the International 
Association of Computer Investigation Specialists.  They're into "computer 
forensics,"  the techniques of picking computersystems apart without destroying 
vital evidence. IACIS, currently run out of Oregon, is comprised of investigators 
in the U.S., Canada, Taiwan and  Ireland.  "Taiwan and Ireland?"  I said.  Are 
<I>Taiwan</I> and <I>Ireland</I>  really in the forefront of this stuff? Well not exactly, 
my informant admitted.  They just happen to have been the first ones to have 
caught on by word of mouth.  Still, the international angle counts, because this is 
obviously an international problem.  Phone-lines go everywhere. 
<P>	There was a Mountie here from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  He 
seemed to be having quite a good time.   Nobody had flung this Canadian out 
because he might pose a foreign security risk. These are cyberspace cops.  They 
still worry a lot about "jurisdictions," but mere geography is the least of their 
troubles. NASA had failed to show.  NASA suffers a lot from computer 
intrusions, in particular from Australian raiders and a well-trumpeted Chaos 
Computer Club case,  and in 1990 there was a brief press flurry when it was 
revealed that one of NASA's Houston branch-exchanges had been systematically 
ripped off by a gang of phone-phreaks.   But the NASA guys had had their 
funding cut.  They were stripping everything. 
<P>	Air Force OSI, its Office of Special  Investigations, is the <I>only</I>  federal 
entity dedicated full-time to computer security.  They'd been expected to show 
up in force, but some of them had cancelled -- a Pentagon budget pinch. 
<P>	As the empties piled up, the guys began joshing around and telling war-
stories.  "These are cops," Thackeray said tolerantly.  "If they're not talking shop 
they talk about women and beer." 
<P>	I heard the story about the guy who, asked for "a copy" of a computer 
disk, <I>photocopied the label on it.</I>  He put the floppy disk onto the glass plate 
of a photocopier.  The blast of static when the copier worked  completely erased 
all the real information on the disk. 
<P>	Some other poor souls threw a whole bag of confiscated diskettes into 
the squad-car trunk next to the police radio.  The powerful radio signal blasted 
them, too. We heard a bit about Dave Geneson, the first computer prosecutor, a 
mainframe-runner in Dade County, turned lawyer.   Dave Geneson was one guy 
who had hit the ground running, a signal virtue in making the transition to 
computer-crime.  It was generally agreed that it was easier to learn the world of 
computers first, then police or prosecutorial work. You could take certain 
computer people and train 'em to successful police work -- but of course they 
had to have the <I>cop mentality.</I>  They had to have street smarts.  Patience.  
Persistence.  And  discretion.   You've got to make sure they're not hotshots, 
show-offs,  "cowboys." 
<P>	Most of the folks in the bar had backgrounds in military intelligence, or 
drugs, or homicide.  It was rudely opined that "military intelligence" was a 
contradiction in terms, while even the grisly world of homicide was considered 
cleaner than drug enforcement.  One guy had been 'way undercover doing dope-
work in Europe for four years straight. "I'm almost recovered now," he said 
deadpan, with the acid black humor that is pure cop.  "Hey, now I can say 
<I>fucker</I>  without putting <I>mother</I>  in front of it." 
<P>	"In the cop world," another guy said earnestly,  "everything is good and 
bad, black and white.  In the computer world everything is gray." 
<P>	One guy -- a founder of the FCIC, who'd been with the group since it was 
just the Colluquy -described his own introduction to the field.  He'd been a 
Washington DC homicide guy called in on a "hacker" case.  From the word 
"hacker," he naturally assumed he was on the trail of a knife-wielding marauder, 
and went to the computer center expecting blood and a body.  When he finally 
figured out what was happening there (after loudly demanding, in vain, that the 
programmers "speak English"),  he called headquarters and told them he was 
clueless about computers.  They told him  nobody else knew diddly either, and to 
get the hell back to work. 
<P>	So, he said, he had proceeded by comparisons. By analogy.  By 
metaphor.  "Somebody broke in to your computer, huh?"  Breaking and entering; 
I can understand that.  How'd he get in?  "Over the phonelines."  Harassing 
phone-calls, I can understand that!  What we need here is a tap and a trace! 
<P>	It worked.  It was better than nothing.   And it worked a lot faster when 
he got hold of another cop who'd done something similar.  And then the two of 
them got another, and another, and pretty soon the Colluquy was a happening 
thing.  It helped a lot that everybody seemed to know Carlton Fitzpatrick, the 
data-processing trainer in Glynco. 
<P>	The ice broke big-time in Memphis in '86.  The Colluquy had attracted a 
bunch of new guys -- Secret Service, FBI, military, other feds, heavy guys. 
Nobody wanted to tell anybody anything.  They suspected that if word got back 
to the home office they'd all be fired.  They passed an uncomfortably guarded 
afternoon. 
<P>	The formalities got them nowhere.  But after the formal session was 
over, the organizers brought in a case of beer.  As soon as the participants 
knocked it off with the bureaucratic ranks and turf-fighting, everything changed.  
"I bared my soul," one veteran reminisced proudly.  By nightfall they were 
building pyramids of empty beer-cans and doing everything but composing a 
team fight song. 
<P>	FCIC were not the only computer-crime people around.  There was 
DATTA (District Attorneys' Technology Theft Association),  though they mostly  
specialized in chip theft, intellectual property, and black-market cases.  There 
was HTCIA  (High Tech Computer Investigators Association), also out in 
Silicon Valley, a year older than FCIC and featuring brilliant people like Donald 
Ingraham.  There was LEETAC (Law Enforcement Electronic Technology 
Assistance Committee)  in Florida, and computercrime units in Illinois and 
Maryland and Texas and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania.   But these were 
local groups.  FCIC were the first to really network nationally and on a federal 
level. 
<P>	FCIC people live on the phone lines.  Not on bulletin board systems -- 
they know very well what boards are, and they know that  boards aren't secure. 
Everyone in the FCIC has a voice-phone bill like you wouldn't believe.  FCIC 
people have been tight with the telco people for a long time.  Telephone 
cyberspace is their native habitat. 
<P>	FCIC has three basic sub-tribes:  the trainers, the security people, and the 
investigators.  That's why it's called an "Investigations Committee" with no 
mention of the term "computer-crime" -- the dreaded "C-word."   FCIC, 
officially, is "an association of agencies rather than individuals;" unofficially, 
this field is small enough that the influence of individuals and individual 
expertise is paramount.  Attendance is by invitation only, and most everyone in 
FCIC considers himself a prophet without honor in his own house. 
<P>	Again and again I heard this,  with different  terms but identical 
sentiments.  "I'd been sitting in the wilderness talking to myself."  "I was totally 
isolated."  "I was desperate."  "FCIC is the best thing there is about computer 
crime in America."   "FCIC is what really works."  "This is where you hear real 
people telling you what's really happening out there, not just lawyers picking 
nits."  "We taught each other everything we knew." 
<P>	The sincerity of these statements convinces me that this is true.  FCIC is 
the real thing and it is invaluable.  It's also very sharply at odds with the rest of 
the traditions and power structure in American law enforcement.   There 
probably  hasn't been anything around as loose and go-getting as the  FCIC since 
the start of the U.S. Secret Service in the 1860s.   FCIC people are living like 
twenty-firstcentury people in a twentieth-century environment, and while there's 
a great deal to be said for that, there's also a great deal to be said against it, and 
those against it happen to control the budgets. I listened to two FCIC guys from 
Jersey compare life histories.  One of them had been a biker in a fairly heavy-
duty gang in the 1960s.  "Oh, did you know so-and-so?" said the other guy from 
Jersey. "Big guy, heavyset?" 
<P>	"Yeah, I knew him." 
<P>	"Yeah, he was one of ours.  He was our plant in the gang." 
<P>	"Really?  Wow!  Yeah, I knew him.  Helluva guy." 
<P>	Thackeray reminisced at length about being tear-gassed blind in the 
November 1969  antiwar protests in Washington Circle, covering them for her 
college paper.  "Oh yeah, I was there," said another cop.  "Glad to hear that tear 
gas hit somethin'.  Haw haw haw."  He'd been so blind himself, he confessed, 
that later that day he'd arrested a small tree. 
<P>	FCIC are an odd group, sifted out by coincidence and necessity, and 
turned into a new kind of cop.   There are a lot of specialized cops in the world -- 
your bunco guys, your drug guys, your tax guys, but the only group that matches 
FCIC for sheer isolation are probably the child-pornography people.  Because 
they both deal with conspirators who are desperate to exchange forbidden data 
and also desperate to hide; and because nobody else in law enforcement even 
wants to hear about it. 
<P>	FCIC people tend to change jobs a lot.  They tend not to get the 
equipment and training they want and need.  And they tend to get sued quite 
often. 
<P>	As the night wore on and a band set up in the bar, the talk grew darker.  
Nothing ever gets done in government, someone opined, until there's a 
<I>disaster.</I>  Computing disasters are awful, but there's no denying that they 
greatly  help the credibility of FCIC people.  The Internet Worm, for instance.  
"For years we'd been warning about that -but it's nothing compared to what's 
coming."  They expect horrors, these people.  They know that nothing will really 
get done until there is a horror.
<P>	Next day we heard an extensive briefing from a guy who'd been a 
computer cop, gotten into hot water with an Arizona city council, and now 
installed computer networks for a living (at a considerable rise in pay).  He 
talked about pulling fiber-optic networks apart. 
<P>	Even a single computer, with enough peripherals, is a literal "network" -- 
a bunch of machines all cabled together, generally with a complexity that puts 
stereo units to shame.   FCIC people invent and publicize  methods of seizing 
computers and maintaining their evidence.   Simple  things, sometimes, but vital 
rules of thumb for street cops, who nowadays often stumble across a busy 
computer in the midst of a drug investigation or a white-collar bust.  For 
instance:  Photograph the system before you touch it.  Label the ends of all the 
cables before you detach anything.  "Park" the heads on the disk drives before 
you move them.  Get the diskettes.  Don't put the diskettes in magnetic fields. 
Don't write on diskettes with ballpoint pens.  Get the manuals.  Get the printouts.  
Get the handwritten notes.  Copy data before you look at it, and then examine 
the copy instead of the original. Now our lecturer distributed copied diagrams of 
a typical LAN or "Local Area Network", which happened to be out of 
Connecticut.  <I>One hundred and fifty-nine</I>  desktop computers, each with its 
own peripherals.  Three "file servers."  Five "star couplers" each with thirty-two 
ports.  One sixteenport coupler off in the corner office.   All these machines 
talking to each other, distributing electronic mail, distributing software, 
distributing,  quite possibly, criminal evidence.  All linked by highcapacity fiber-
optic cable.  A bad guy -- cops talk a lot about "bad guys"  -- might be lurking on 
PC #47 or #123 and distributing his ill doings onto some dupe's "personal"  
machine in another office -- or  another floor -- or, quite possibly, two or three 
miles away!   Or,  conceivably, the evidence might be "data-striped" -- split up 
into meaningless slivers stored, one by one, on a whole crowd of different disk 
drives. 
<P>	The lecturer challenged us for solutions.  I for one was utterly clueless.  
As far as I could figure, the Cossacks were at the gate; there were probably more 
disks in this single building than were seized during the entirety of Operation 
Sundevil. 
<P>	"Inside informant," somebody said.  Right. There's always the human 
angle, something easy to forget when contemplating the arcane recesses of high 
technology.  Cops are skilled at getting people to talk, and computer people, 
given a chair and some sustained attention, will talk about their  computers till 
their throats go raw.  There's a case on record of a single question -- "How'd you 
do it?" -eliciting a forty-five-minute videotaped confession from a computer 
criminal who not only completely incriminated himself but drew helpful 
diagrams. 
<P>	Computer people talk.  Hackers <I>brag.</I>   Phonephreaks talk 
<I>pathologically</I>  -- why else are they stealing phone-codes, if not to natter for 
ten hours straight to their friends on an opposite seaboard? Computer-literate 
people do in fact possess an arsenal of nifty gadgets and techniques that would 
allow them to conceal all kinds of exotic skullduggery, and if they could only 
<I>shut up</I>  about it, they could probably get away with all manner of amazing 
information-crimes.   But that's just not how it works -- or at least, that's not how 
it's worked <I>so far.</I> 
<P>	Most every phone-phreak ever busted has swiftly implicated his mentors, 
his disciples, and his friends.  Most every white-collar computer-criminal, 
smugly convinced that his clever scheme is bulletproof,  swiftly learns otherwise 
when, for the first time in his life, an actual no-kidding policeman leans over, 
grabs the front of his shirt, looks him  right in the eye and says:  "All right, 
<I>asshole</I> --  you and me are going downtown!"   All the hardware in the world 
will not insulate your nerves from these actual real-life sensations of terror and 
guilt. 
<P>	Cops know ways to get from point A to point Z without thumbing 
through every letter in some smart-ass bad-guy's  alphabet.  Cops know how to 
cut to the chase.  Cops know a lot of things other people don't know. 
<P>	Hackers know a lot of things other people don't know, too.  Hackers 
know, for instance, how to sneak into your computer through the phone-lines.  
But cops  can show up <I>right on your doorstep</I>  and carry off <I>you</I>  and your 
computer in separate steel boxes.   A cop interested in hackers can grab them 
and grill them.  A hacker interested in cops has to depend on hearsay, 
underground legends, and what cops are willing to publicly reveal.  And the 
Secret Service didn't get named "the <I>Secret</I>  Service" because they blab a lot. 
Some people, our lecturer informed us, were under the mistaken impression that 
it was "impossible" to tap a fiber-optic line.  Well, he announced, he and his son 
had just whipped up a fiber-optic tap in his workshop at home.  He passed it 
around the audience, along with a circuit-covered LAN plug-in card so we'd all 
recognize one if we saw it on a case.  We all had a look. 
<P>	The tap was a classic "Goofy Prototype" -- a thumb-length rounded metal 
cylinder with a pair of plastic brackets on it.  From one end dangled three thin 
black cables, each of which ended in a tiny black plastic cap.   When you 
plucked the safety-cap  off the end of a cable,  you could see the glass fiber  - no 
thicker than a pinhole. 

<P>	Our lecturer informed us that the metal cylinder was a "wavelength 
division multiplexer." Apparently, what one did was to cut the fiber-optic cable, 
insert two of the legs into the cut to complete the network again, and then read 
any passing data on the line by hooking up the third leg to some kind of monitor.  
Sounded simple enough.  I wondered why nobody had thought of it before.  I 
also wondered whether this guy's son back at the workshop had any teenage 
friends. 
<P>	We had a break.  The guy sitting next to me was wearing a giveaway 
baseball cap advertising the Uzi submachine gun.  We had a desultory chat about 
the merits of Uzis.  Long a favorite of the Secret Service, it seems Uzis went out 
of fashion with the advent of the Persian Gulf War, our Arab allies taking some 
offense at Americans toting Israeli weapons.  Besides, I was informed by another 
expert, Uzis jam.  The equivalent weapon of choice today is the Heckler &amp; 
Koch, manufactured in Germany. 

<P>	The guy with the Uzi cap was a forensic photographer.  He also did a lot 
of photographic surveillance work in computer crime cases.   He  used to, that is, 
until the firings in Phoenix.  He was now a private investigator and, with his 
wife, ran a photography salon specializing in weddings and portrait photos.  At -
- one must repeat -- a considerable rise in income. He was still FCIC.  If you 
were FCIC, and you needed to talk to an expert about forensic photography, 
well, there he was, willing and able.  If he hadn't shown up, people would have 
missed him. 
<P>	Our lecturer had raised the point that preliminary investigation of a 
computer system is vital before any seizure is undertaken.  It's vital to 
understand how many machines are in there, what kinds there are, what kind of 
operating system they use,  how many people use them, where the actual data 
itself is stored.  To simply barge into an office demanding "all the computers" is 
a recipe for swift disaster. 
<P>	This entails some discreet inquiries beforehand. In fact, what it entails is 
basically undercover work. An intelligence operation.   <I>Spying,</I>  not to put too 
fine a point on it. 
<P>	In a chat after the lecture, I asked an attendee whether "trashing" might 
work. 
<P>	I received a swift briefing on the theory and  practice of "trash covers."  
Police "trash covers," like "mail covers" or like wiretaps, require the agreement 
of a judge.  This obtained, the "trashing" work of cops is just like that of hackers, 
only more so and much better organized.  So much so, I was informed, that 
mobsters in Phoenix make extensive use of locked garbage cans picked up by a 
specialty high-security trash company. 
<P>	In one case, a tiger team of Arizona cops had trashed a local residence 
for four months.  Every week they showed up on the municipal garbage truck, 
disguised as garbagemen, and carried the contents of the suspect cans off to a 
shade tree, where they combed through the garbage -- a messy task, especially 
considering that one of the occupants was undergoing kidney dialysis.  All useful 
documents were cleaned, dried and examined.  A discarded typewriter-ribbon 
was an  especially valuable source of data, as its long onestrike ribbon of film 
contained the contents of every letter mailed out of the house.  The letters were 
neatly retyped by a police secretary equipped with a large desk-mounted 
magnifying glass. 
<P>	There is something weirdly disquieting about the whole subject of 
"trashing" -- an unsuspected and indeed rather disgusting mode of deep personal  
vulnerability.  Things that we pass by every day, that we take utterly for granted, 
can be exploited with so little work.   Once discovered, the knowledge of these 
vulnerabilities tend to spread. 
<P>	Take the lowly subject of <I>manhole covers.</I>  The humble manhole cover 
reproduces many of the dilemmas of computer-security in miniature. Manhole 
covers are, of course, technological artifacts, access-points to our buried urban 
infrastructure.  To the vast majority of us, manhole covers are invisible.  They 
are also vulnerable.  For many years now, the Secret Service has made a point of 
caulking manhole covers along all routes of the Presidential motorcade.   This is, 
of course, to deter terrorists from leaping out of underground ambush or, more 
likely, planting remote-control carsmashing bombs beneath the street. 
<P>	Lately, manhole covers have seen more and more criminal exploitation, 
especially in New York City.  Recently, a telco in New York City discovered 
that a cable television service had been sneaking into telco manholes and 
installing cable service alongside the phone-lines -- <I>without paying royalties.</I>   
New York companies have also suffered a general plague of (a) underground 
copper cable  theft; (b) dumping of garbage, including toxic waste, and (c) hasty 
dumping of murder victims. 
<P>	Industry complaints reached the ears of an innovative New England 
industrial-security company, and the result was a new product known as "the 
Intimidator," a thick titanium-steel bolt with a precisely machined head that 
requires a special device to unscrew.  All these "keys" have registered serial 
numbers kept on file with the manufacturer. There are now some thousands of 
these "Intimidator" bolts being sunk into American pavements wherever our 
President passes, like some macabre parody of strewn roses.   They are  also 
spreading as fast as steel dandelions around US military bases and many centers 
of private industry. 
<P>	Quite likely it has never occurred to you to  peer under a manhole cover, 
perhaps climb down and walk around down there with a flashlight, just to see 
what it's like.  Formally speaking, this might be trespassing, but if you didn't hurt 
anything, and didn't make an absolute habit of it, nobody would really care.  The 
freedom to sneak under manholes was likely a freedom you never intended to 
exercise. 
<P>	You now are rather less likely to have that freedom at all.  You may 
never even have missed it until you read about it here, but if you're in New York 
City it's gone, and elsewhere it's likely going. This is one of the things that 
crime, and the reaction to crime,  does to us. 
<P>	The tenor of the meeting now changed as the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation arrived.  The EFF, whose personnel and history will be examined in 
detail in the next chapter, are a pioneering civil liberties group who arose in 
direct response to the Hacker Crackdown of 1990. 
<P>	Now Mitchell Kapor, the Foundation's president, and Michael Godwin, 
its chief attorney, were confronting federal law enforcement <I>mano a mano</I> for 
the first time ever.  Ever alert to the manifold uses of publicity, Mitch Kapor and 
Mike Godwin had brought their own journalist in tow: Robert Draper, from 
Austin, whose recent wellreceived book about ROLLING STONE magazine was 
still on the stands.  Draper was on assignment for TEXAS MONTHLY. 
<P>	The Steve Jackson/EFF civil lawsuit against the Chicago Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Task Force was a matter of considerable regional interest in 
Texas. There were now two Austinite journalists here on the case.  In fact, 
counting Godwin (a former Austinite and former journalist) there were three of 
us.  Lunch was like Old Home Week. 
<P>	Later, I took Draper up to my hotel room.  We had a long frank talk 
about the case, networking earnestly like a miniature freelance-journo version of 
the FCIC:  privately confessing the numerous  blunders of journalists covering 
the story, and trying hard to figure out who was who and what the hell was really 
going on out there.  I showed Draper everything I had dug out of the Hilton 
trashcan.  We pondered the ethics of "trashing" for a while, and agreed that they 
were dismal.  We also agreed that finding a SPRINT bill on your first time out 
was a heck of a coincidence. 
<P>	First I'd "trashed" -- and now, mere hours later, I'd bragged to someone 
else.   Having entered the lifestyle of hackerdom, I was now, unsurprisingly, 
following  its logic.  Having discovered something remarkable through a 
surreptitious action, I of course <I>had</I>  to "brag," and to drag the passing Draper 
into my iniquities.  I felt I needed a witness. Otherwise nobody would have 
believed what I'd discovered.... 
<P>	Back at the meeting, Thackeray cordially, if rather tentatively, introduced 
Kapor and Godwin to her colleagues.  Papers were distributed.  Kapor took 
center stage.  The brilliant Bostonian high-tech entrepreneur, normally the hawk 
in his own administration and quite an effective public speaker, seemed visibly 
nervous, and frankly admitted as much.   He began by saying he consided 
computer-intrusion to be morally wrong, and that the EFF was not a "hacker 
defense fund," despite what had appeared in print.    Kapor chatted a bit about 
the basic motivations of his group, emphasizing their good faith and willingness 
to listen and seek common ground with law enforcement -- when, er,  possible. 

<P>	Then, at Godwin's urging, Kapor suddenly remarked that EFF's own 
Internet machine had been "hacked" recently, and that EFF did not consider this 
incident amusing. 
<P>	After this surprising confession, things began to loosen up quite rapidly.  
Soon Kapor was fielding questions, parrying objections, challenging definitions, 
and juggling paradigms with something akin to his usual gusto. 
<P>	Kapor seemed to score quite an effect with his shrewd and skeptical 
analysis of the merits of telco "Caller-ID" services.  (On this topic, FCIC and 
EFF have never been at loggerheads, and have no particular established 
earthworks to defend.) Caller-ID has generally been promoted as a privacy 
service for consumers, a presentation Kapor described as a "smokescreen,"  the 
real point of Caller-ID being to <I>allow corporate customers to build extensive 
commercial databases  on  everybody who phones or faxes them.</I>  Clearly, few 
people in the room had considered this possibility, except perhaps for two late-
arrivals from  US WEST RBOC security, who chuckled nervously. 
<P>	Mike Godwin then made an extensive presentation on "Civil Liberties 
Implications of Computer Searches and Seizures."  Now, at last, we  were 
getting to the real nitty-gritty here, real political horse-trading.  The audience 
listened with close attention, angry mutters rising occasionally:  "He's trying to 
teach us our jobs!"  "We've been thinking about this for years!  We think about 
these issues every day!"  "If I didn't seize the works, I'd be sued by the guy's 
victims!"   "I'm violating the law if I leave ten thousand disks full of illegal 
<I>pirated software</I> and <I>stolen codes!</I>"   "It's our job to make sure people don't 
trash the Constitution -- we're the <I>defenders</I>  of the Constitution!"  "We seize 
stuff when we know it will be forfeited anyway as restitution for the victim!" 
<P>	"If it's forfeitable, then don't get a search warrant, get a forfeiture 
warrant,"  Godwin suggested coolly.  He further remarked that most suspects in 
computer crime don't <I>want</I>  to see their computers vanish out the door, headed 
God knew where, for who knows how long.  They might not mind a search, even 
an extensive search, but they want their machines searched on-site. "Are they 
gonna feed us?"  somebody asked sourly. "How about if you take copies of the 
data?" Godwin parried. 
<P>	"That'll never stand up in court." "Okay, you make copies, give <I>them</I>  
the copies, and take the originals." 
<P>	Hmmm. 
<P>	Godwin championed bulletin-board systems as repositories of First 
Amendment protected free speech.  He complained that federal computercrime 
training manuals gave boards a bad press, suggesting that they are hotbeds of 
crime haunted  by pedophiles and crooks, whereas the vast majority of the 
nation's thousands of boards are completely innocuous, and nowhere near so 
romantically suspicious. 

<P>	People who run boards violently resent it when their systems are seized, 
and their dozens (or hundreds) of users look on in abject horror.   Their  rights of 
free expression are cut short.  Their right to associate with other people is 
infringed.  And their privacy is violated as their private electronic mail becomes 
police property.


<P>	Not a soul spoke up to defend the practice of seizing boards.   The issue 
passed in chastened silence.   Legal principles aside -- (and those principles 
cannot be settled without laws passed or court precedents) -- seizing bulletin 
boards has become public-relations poison for American computer police. 
<P>	And anyway, it's not entirely necessary.  If you're a cop, you can get 'most 
everything you need from a pirate board, just by using an inside informant. 
Plenty of vigilantes -- well, <I>concerned citizens</I> -will inform police the moment 
they see a pirate board hit their area  (and will tell the police all about it, in such 
technical detail, actually, that you kinda wish they'd shut up).   They will happily 
supply police with extensive downloads or printouts.  It's <I>impossible</I> to keep 
this fluid electronic information out of the hands of police. Some people in the 
electronic community become enraged at the prospect of cops "monitoring" 
bulletin boards.   This does have touchy aspects, as Secret Service people in 
particular examine bulletin boards with some  regularity.    But to expect 
electronic police to be deaf dumb and blind in regard to this particular medium 
rather flies in the face of common sense. Police watch television, listen to radio, 
read newspapers and magazines; why should the new medium of boards be 
different?   Cops can exercise the same access to electronic information as 
everybody else.   As we have seen, quite a few computer police maintain <I>their 
own</I>  bulletin  boards, including anti-hacker "sting" boards, which have 
generally proven quite effective. 
<P>	As a final clincher, their Mountie friends in Canada (and colleagues in 
Ireland and Taiwan) don't have First Amendment or American constitutional 
restrictions, but they do have phone lines, and can call any bulletin board in 
America whenever they please.  The same technological determinants that play 
into the hands of hackers, phone phreaks and software pirates can play into the 
hands of police.  "Technological determinants" don't have <I>any</I>  human 
allegiances.  They're not black or white, or Establishment or Underground, or 
pro-or-anti anything. 
<P>	Godwin  complained at length about what he called "the Clever Hobbyist 
hypothesis"  -- the assumption that the "hacker" you're busting is clearly a 
technical genius, and must therefore by searched with extreme thoroughness.  
So:  from the  law's point of view, why risk missing anything?  Take the works.  
Take the guy's computer.  Take his books. Take his notebooks.  Take the 
electronic drafts of his love letters. Take his Walkman.  Take his wife's 
computer.  Take his dad's computer.  Take his kid sister's computer.   Take his 
employer's computer. Take his compact disks -- they <I>might</I> be CD-ROM 
disks, cunningly disguised as pop music.  Take his laser printer -- he might have 
hidden something vital in the printer's 5meg of memory.  Take his software 
manuals and hardware documentation. Take his science-fiction novels and his 
simulationgaming books.  Take his Nintendo Game-Boy and his Pac-Man arcade 
game.  Take his answering machine, take his telephone out of the wall.  Take 
anything remotely suspicious. 
<P>	Godwin pointed out that most "hackers" are not, in fact, clever genius 
hobbyists.  Quite a few are crooks and grifters who don't have much in the way 
of technical sophistication; just some rule-of-thumb rip-off techniques.  The 
same goes for most fifteenyear-olds who've downloaded a code-scanning 
program from a pirate board.   There's no real need to seize everything in sight.  
It doesn't require an entire computer system and ten thousand disks to prove a 
case in court. 
<P>	What if the computer is the instrumentality of a crime? someone 
demanded. 
<P>	Godwin admitted quietly that the doctrine of seizing the instrumentality 
of a crime was pretty well established in the American legal system. The 
meeting broke up.  Godwin and Kapor had to leave.  Kapor was testifying next 
morning before the Massachusetts Department Of Public Utility, about ISDN 
narrowband wide-area networking. 
<P>	As soon as they were gone, Thackeray seemed elated.   She had taken a 
great risk with this.  Her colleagues had not, in fact, torn Kapor and Godwin's 
heads off.  She was very proud of them, and told them so. 
<P>	"Did you hear what Godwin said about <I>instrumentality of a crime?</I>"  
she exulted, to nobody in particular.  "Wow, that means <I>Mitch isn't going to sue 
me.</I>"
<P>	America's computer police are an interesting group.  As a social 
phenomenon they are far more interesting, and far more important, than teenage 
phone phreaks and computer hackers.  First, they're older and wiser; not dizzy 
hobbyists with leaky morals, but  seasoned adult professionals with all the 
responsibilities of public service.  And, unlike hackers, they possess not merely 
<I>technical</I> power alone, but heavy-duty legal and social authority. 
<P>	And, very interestingly, they are just as much at sea in cyberspace as 
everyone else.  They are not happy about this.  Police are authoritarian by nature, 
and prefer to obey rules and precedents.   (Even those police who secretly enjoy 
a fast ride in rough  territory will soberly disclaim any "cowboy" attitude.) But in 
cyberspace there <I>are</I>  no rules and precedents.  They are groundbreaking 
pioneers, Cyberspace Rangers, whether they like it or not. 
<P>	In my opinion, any teenager enthralled by computers, fascinated by the 
ins and outs of computer security, and attracted by the lure of specialized forms 
of knowledge and power, would do well to forget all about "hacking" and set his 
(or her) sights on becoming a fed.   Feds can trump hackers at almost every 
single thing hackers do, including gathering intelligence, undercover disguise, 
trashing, phone-tapping,  building dossiers, networking, and infiltrating 
computer systems -<I>criminal</I> computer systems.   Secret Service agents know 
more about phreaking, coding and carding than most phreaks can find out in 
years, and when it comes to viruses, break-ins, software bombs and trojan 
horses, Feds have direct access to red-hot confidential information that is only 
vague rumor in the underground. 
<P>	And if it's an impressive public rep you're after, there are few people in 
the world who can be so chillingly impressive as a well-trained, well-armed 
United States Secret Service agent. Of course, a few personal sacrifices are 
necessary in order to obtain that power and knowledge.  First, you'll have the 
galling discipline of belonging to a large organization;  but the world of 
computer crime is still so small, and so amazingly fast-moving, that it will 
remain spectacularly fluid for years to come.   The second sacrifice is that you'll 
have to give up ripping people off.  This is not a great loss.  Abstaining from the 
use of illegal drugs, also necessary, will be a boon to your health. 
<P>	A career in computer security is not a bad choice for a young man or 
woman today.  The field will almost certainly expand drastically in years to 
come.  If you are a teenager today, by the time you become a professional, the 
pioneers you have read about in this book will be the grand old men and women 
of the field, swamped by their many disciples and successors.   Of course, some 
of them, like William P. Wood of the 1865 Secret Service, may well be mangled 
in the whirring machinery of legal controversy; but by the time you enter the 
computer-crime field, it may have stabilized somewhat, while remaining 
entertainingly challenging. 
<P>	But you can't just have a badge.  You have to win it.  First, there's the 
federal law enforcement training.  And it's hard -- it's a challenge.  A real 
challenge -- not for wimps and rodents. 
<P>	Every Secret Service agent must complete gruelling courses at the 
Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.  (In fact, Secret Service agents are 
periodically re-trained during their entire careers.) In order to get a glimpse of 
what this might be like, I myself travelled to FLETC. The Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center is a 1500-acre facility on Georgia's Atlantic coast.   
It's a milieu of marshgrass, seabirds,  damp, clinging sea-breezes, palmettos, 
mosquitos, and bats.   Until 1974, it was a  Navy Air Base, and still features a 
working runway, and some WWII vintage blockhouses and officers' quarters.  
The Center has since benefitted by a forty-million-dollar retrofit, but there's still 
enough forest and swamp on the facility for the Border Patrol to put in tracking 
practice. 
<P>	As a town, "Glynco" scarcely exists.  The nearest real town is Brunswick, 
a few miles down Highway 17, where I stayed at the aptly named Marshview 
Holiday Inn.   I had Sunday dinner at a seafood restaurant called "Jinright's," 
where I feasted on deep-fried alligator tail.  This local favorite was a heaped 
basket of bite-sized chunks of white, tender, almost fluffy reptile meat, steaming 
in a peppered batter crust.  Alligator makes a culinary experience that's hard to 
forget, especially when liberally basted with homemade cocktail sauce from a 
Jinright squeeze-bottle. 
<P>	The crowded clientele were tourists, fishermen, local black folks in their 
Sunday best, and white Georgian locals who all seemed to bear an uncanny 
resemblance to Georgia humorist Lewis Grizzard. The 2,400 students from 75 
federal agencies who make up the FLETC population scarcely seem to make a 
dent in the low-key local scene.   The students look like tourists, and the teachers 
seem to have taken on much of the relaxed air of the Deep South.   My host was 
Mr. Carlton Fitzpatrick, the Program Coordinator of the Financial Fraud 
Institute.  Carlton Fitzpatrick is a mustached, sinewy, well-tanned Alabama 
native somewhere near his late forties, with a fondness for chewing tobacco, 
powerful computers, and salty, down-home homilies. We'd met before, at FCIC 
in Arizona. 
<P>	The Financial Fraud Institute is one of the nine divisions at FLETC. 
Besides Financial Fraud, there's Driver &amp; Marine, Firearms, and Physical 
Training. These are specialized pursuits.  There are also five general training 
divisions:  Basic Training, Operations, Enforcement Techniques, Legal Division, 
and Behavioral Science. 
<P>	Somewhere in this curriculum is everything necessary to turn green 
college graduates into federal agents.  First they're given ID cards. Then they get 
the rather miserable-looking blue coveralls known as "smurf suits."  The trainees 
are assigned a barracks and a cafeteria, and immediately set on FLETC's bone-
grinding physical training routine.  Besides the obligatory  daily jogging -- (the 
trainers run up danger flags beside the track when the humidity rises high 
enough to threaten heat stroke) - there's the Nautilus machines, the martial arts, 
the survival skills.... 
<P>	The eighteen federal agencies who maintain onsite academies at FLETC 
employ a wide variety of specialized law enforcement units, some of them rather 
arcane.   There's Border Patrol, IRS Criminal Investigation Division, Park 
Service, Fish and Wildlife, Customs, Immigration, Secret Service and the 
Treasury's uniformed subdivisions....  If you're a federal cop and you don't work 
for the FBI, you train at FLETC.   This includes people as apparently obscure as 
the agents of the Railroad Retirement Board Inspector General.  Or the 
Tennessee Valley Authority Police, who are in fact federal police officers, and 
can and do arrest criminals on the federal property of the Tennessee Valley 
Authority. 
<P>	And then there are the computer-crime people. All sorts, all backgrounds.  
Mr. Fitzpatrick  is not  jealous of his specialized knowledge.   Cops all over, in 
every branch of service, may feel a need to learn what he can teach.   
Backgrounds don't matter much.  Fitzpatrick himself  was originally a Border 
Patrol veteran, then became a Border Patrol instructor at FLETC.  His Spanish is 
still fluent -- but he found himself strangely fascinated when the first computers 
showed up at the Training Center. Fitzpatrick did have a background in electrical 
engineering, and though he never considered himself a computer hacker, he 
somehow found himself writing useful little programs for this new and 
promising gizmo. 
<P>	He began looking into the general subject of computers and crime, 
reading Donn Parker's books  and articles, keeping an ear cocked for war stories, 
useful insights from the field, the up-and-coming people of the local computer-
crime and hightechnology units....  Soon he got a reputation around FLETC as 
the resident "computer expert," and that reputation alone brought him more 
exposure, more experience -- until one day he looked around, and sure enough 
he <I>was</I>  a federal computer-crime expert. 
<P>	In fact, this unassuming, genial man may be <I>the</I>  federal computer-
crime expert.   There are plenty of very good computer people, and plenty of 
very good federal investigators, but the area where these worlds of expertise 
overlap is very slim.  And Carlton Fitzpatrick has been right at the center of  that 
since 1985, the first year of the Colluquy, a group which owes much to his 
influence. 
<P>	He seems quite at home in his modest, acoustic-tiled office, with its 
Ansel Adams-style Western photographic art, a gold-framed Senior Instructor 
Certificate, and a towering bookcase crammed with three-ring binders with 
ominous titles such as <I>Datapro Reports on Information Security</I> and <I>CFCA 
Telecom Security '90.</I> 

<P>	The phone rings every ten minutes; colleagues show up at the door to 
chat about new developments in locksmithing or to shake their heads over the 
latest dismal developments in the BCCI global banking scandal. 
<P>	Carlton Fitzpatrick is a fount of computer-crime war-stories, related in an 
acerbic drawl.  He tells me the colorful tale of a hacker caught in California 
some years back.   He'd been raiding systems, typing code without a detectable 
break, for twenty, twenty-four, thirty-six hours straight.  Not just logged on -- 
<I>typing.</I>   Investigators were baffled.  Nobody could do that.  Didn't he have to 
go to the bathroom? Was it some kind of automatic keyboard-whacking device 
that could actually type code? 
<P>	A raid on the suspect's home revealed a situation of astonishing squalor.  
The hacker turned out to be a Pakistani computer-science student who had 
flunked out of a California university.  He'd gone completely underground as an 
illegal electronic immigrant,  and was selling stolen phoneservice to stay alive.  
The place was not merely  messy and dirty, but in a state of psychotic disorder. 
Powered by some weird mix of culture shock, computer addiction, and 
amphetamines, the suspect had in fact been sitting in front of his computer for a 
day and a half straight, with snacks and drugs at hand on the edge of his desk 
and a chamber-pot under his chair. 
<P>	Word about stuff like this gets around in the hacker-tracker community. 
<P>	Carlton Fitzpatrick takes me for a guided tour by car around the FLETC 
grounds.   One of our first  sights is the biggest indoor firing range in the world. 
There are federal trainees in there, Fitzpatrick assures me politely, blasting away 
with a wide variety of automatic weapons: Uzis, Glocks, AK-47s....   He's 
willing to take me inside.   I tell him I'm sure that's really interesting, but I'd 
rather see his computers. Carlton Fitzpatrick seems quite surprised and pleased.  
I'm apparently the first journalist he's ever seen who has turned down the 
shooting gallery in favor of microchips. 
<P>	Our next stop is a favorite with touring Congressmen:  the three-mile 
long FLETC driving range.  Here trainees of the Driver &amp; Marine Division are 
taught high-speed pursuit skills, setting and breaking road-blocks, diplomatic 
security driving for VIP limousines....  A favorite FLETC pastime is to strap a 
passing Senator into the passenger seat beside a Driver &amp; Marine trainer, hit a 
hundred miles an hour, then take it right into "the skid-pan," a section of greased 
track  where two tons of Detroit iron can whip and spin like a hockey puck. 
<P>	Cars don't fare well at FLETC.   First they're rifled again and again for 
search practice.  Then they do  25,000 miles of high-speed pursuit training; they 
get about seventy miles per set of steel-belted radials.   Then it's off to the skid 
pan, where sometimes they roll and tumble headlong in the grease.   When 
they're sufficiently grease-stained, dented, and creaky, they're sent to the 
roadblock  unit, where they're battered without pity.  And finally then they're 
sacrificed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, whose trainees learn 
the ins and outs of car-bomb work by blowing them into smoking wreckage. 
<P>	There's a railroad box-car on the FLETC grounds, and a large grounded 
boat, and a propless plane; all training-grounds for searches.   The plane sits 
forlornly on a patch of weedy tarmac next to an eerie blockhouse known as the 
"ninja compound," where anti-terrorism specialists practice hostage rescues.  As 
I gaze on this creepy paragon of modern low-intensity warfare, my nerves are 
jangled by a sudden staccato outburst of automatic weapons fire, somewhere in 
the woods to my right.  "Ninemillimeter," Fitzpatrick judges calmly. 
<P>	Even the eldritch ninja compound pales somewhat compared to the truly 
surreal area known  as "the raid-houses."   This is a street lined on both sides 
with nondescript concrete-block houses with flat pebbled roofs.  They were once 
officers' quarters. Now they are training grounds.   The first one to our left, 
Fitzpatrick tells me, has been specially adapted for computer search-and-seizure 
practice.  Inside it has been wired for video from top to bottom, with eighteen 
pan-and-tilt remotely controlled videocams mounted on walls and in corners.  
Every movement of the trainee agent is recorded live by teachers, for later taped 
analysis.  Wasted movements, hesitations, possibly lethal tactical mistakes -- all 
are gone over in detail. 
<P>	Perhaps the weirdest single aspect of this building is its front door, 
scarred and scuffed all along the bottom, from the repeated impact, day after day, 
of federal shoe-leather. 
<P>	Down at the far end of the row of raid-houses some people are practicing 
a murder.   We drive by slowly as some very young and rather nervouslooking 
federal trainees interview a heavyset bald man on the raid-house lawn.  Dealing 
with murder takes a lot of practice; first you have to learn to  control your own 
instinctive disgust and panic,  then you have to learn to control the reactions of a 
nerveshredded crowd of civilians, some of whom may have just lost a loved one, 
some of whom may be murderers -- quite possibly both at once. 
<P>	A dummy plays the corpse.  The roles of the bereaved, the morbidly 
curious, and the homicidal  are played, for pay, by local Georgians:  waitresses, 
musicians, most anybody who needs to moonlight and can learn a script.   These 
people, some of whom are FLETC regulars year after year, must surely have one 
of the strangest jobs in the world. 
<P>	Something about the scene:  "normal" people in a weird situation, 
standing around talking in bright Georgia sunshine, unsuccessfully pretending 
that something dreadful has gone on, while a dummy lies inside on faked 
bloodstains....  While behind this  weird masquerade, like a nested set of Russian 
dolls, are grim future realities of real death, real violence, real murders of real 
people, that these young agents will really investigate, many times during their 
careers....  Over and over....  Will those anticipated  murders look like this, feel 
like this -- not as "real" as these amateur actors are trying to make it seem, but 
both as "real," and as numbingly unreal, as watching fake people standing 
around on a fake lawn? Something about this scene unhinges me.  It seems 
nightmarish to me,  Kafkaesque.   I simply don't know how to take it; my head is 
turned around; I don't know whether to laugh, cry, or just shudder. 
<P>	When the tour is over, Carlton Fitzpatrick and I talk about computers.  
For the first time cyberspace seems like quite a comfortable place.  It seems very 
real to me suddenly, a place where I know what I'm  talking about, a place I'm 
used to.   It's real.  "Real." Whatever. 
<P>	Carlton Fitzpatrick is the only person I've met in cyberspace circles who 
is happy with his present equipment.  He's got a 5 Meg RAM PC with a 112 meg 
hard disk; a 660 meg's on the way.  He's got a Compaq 386 desktop, and a 
Zenith 386 laptop with 120 meg.  Down the hall is a NEC Multi-Sync 2A with a 
CD-ROM drive and a 9600 baud modem with four com-lines.  There's a training 
minicomputer, and a  10-meg local mini just for the Center, and a lab-full of 
student PC clones and half-a-dozen Macs or so. There's a Data General MV 
2500 with 8 meg on board and a 370 meg disk. 
<P>	Fitzpatrick plans to run a UNIX board on the Data General when he's 
finished beta-testing the  software for it, which he wrote himself.  It'll have E-
mail features, massive files on all manner of computer-crime and investigation 
procedures, and will follow the computer-security specifics of the Department of 
Defense "Orange Book."  He thinks  it will be the biggest BBS in the federal 
government. Will it have <I>Phrack</I> on it?  I ask wryly. 
<P>	Sure, he tells me.  <I>Phrack,</I> <I>TAP,</I>  <I>Computer Underground Digest,</I> 
all that stuff.  With  proper disclaimers, of course. 
<P>	I ask him if he plans to be the sysop.  Running a system that size is very 
time-consuming, and Fitzpatrick teaches two three-hour courses every day. 
<P>	No, he says seriously,  FLETC has to get its money worth out of the 
instructors.  He thinks he can get a local volunteer to do it, a high-school student. 
He says a bit more, something I think about an Eagle Scout law-enforcement 
liaison program, but my mind has rocketed off in disbelief. 
<P>	"You're going to put a <I>teenager</I> in charge of a federal security BBS?"  
I'm speechless.  It hasn't escaped my notice that the FLETC Financial Fraud 
Institute is the <I>ultimate</I> hacker-trashing target; there is stuff in here, stuff of 
such utter and consummate cool by every standard of the digital underground.... I 
imagine the hackers of my acquaintance, fainting dead-away from forbidden-
knowledge greed-fits, at the mere prospect of cracking the superultra top-secret 
computers used to train the Secret Service in computer-crime.... 
<P>	"Uhm, Carlton," I babble, "I'm sure he's a really nice kid and all, but 
that's a terrible temptation to set in front of somebody who's, you know, into 
computers and just starting out..." 
<P>	"Yeah," he says, "that did occur to me."  For the first time I begin to 
suspect that he's pulling my leg. 
<P>	He seems proudest when he shows me an ongoing project called JICC, 
Joint Intelligence Control Council.  It's based on the services provided by EPIC, 
the El Paso Intelligence Center, which supplies data and intelligence to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service, the Coast Guard, and the 
state police of the four southern border states.  Certain EPIC files can now be 
accessed by drug-enforcement police of Central America, South America and the 
Caribbean, who can also trade information among themselves. Using a telecom 
program called "White Hat," written by two brothers named Lopez from the 
Dominican Republic, police can now network internationally on inexpensive 
PCs.   Carlton Fitzpatrick is teaching a class of drug-war agents from the Third 
World, and he's very proud of their progress.   Perhaps soon the sophisticated 
smuggling networks of the Medellin Cartel will be matched by a sophisticated 
computer network of the Medellin Cartel's sworn enemies.   They'll track boats, 
track contraband, track the international drug-lords who now leap over borders 
with great  ease, defeating the police through the clever use of fragmented 
national jurisdictions. 
<P>	JICC and EPIC must remain beyond the scope of this book.   They seem 
to me to be very large topics fraught with complications that I am not fit to 
judge.   I do know, however, that the international, computer-assisted 
networking of police, across national boundaries, is something that Carlton 
Fitzpatrick considers very important, a harbinger of  a desirable future.  I also 
know that networks by their nature ignore physical boundaries.  And I also know 
that where you put communications you put a community, and that when those 
communities become self-aware they will fight to preserve themselves and to 
expand their influence.   I make  no judgements whether this is good or bad.  It's 
just cyberspace; it's just the way things are. 
<P>	I asked Carlton Fitzpatrick what advice he would have for a twenty-year-
old who wanted to shine someday in the world of electronic law enforcement. 
<P>	He told me that the number one rule was simply not to be scared of 
computers.   You don't need to be an obsessive "computer weenie," but you 
mustn't be buffaloed just because some machine looks fancy.  The advantages 
computers give smart crooks are matched by the advantages they give  smart 
cops.  Cops in the future will have to enforce the law "with their heads, not their 
holsters."   Today you can make good cases without ever leaving your office.  In 
the future, cops who resist the computer revolution will never get far beyond 
walking a beat. 
<P>	I asked Carlton Fitzpatrick if he had some single message for the public; 
some single thing that he would most like the American public to know about 
his work.


<P>	He thought about it while.  "Yes," he said finally. "<I>Tell</I> me the rules, 
and I'll <I>teach</I> those rules!"  He looked me straight in the eye.  "I do the best 
that I can."
