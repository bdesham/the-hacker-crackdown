<h2>PART TWO:  The Digital Underground</h2>

<P>	The date was May 9, 1990.  The Pope was touring Mexico City.   
Hustlers from the Medellin Cartel were  trying to buy black-market Stinger 
missiles in Florida.  On the comics page, Doonesbury character Andy was 
dying of AIDS.
<P>	 And then.... a highly unusual item whose novelty and calculated 
rhetoric won it headscratching attention in newspapers all over America. 
The US Attorney's office in Phoenix, Arizona, had issued a press release 
announcing a nationwide law enforcement crackdown against "illegal 
computer hacking activities."  The sweep was officially known as 
"Operation Sundevil." 
<P>	Eight paragraphs in the press release gave the bare facts:  twenty-
seven search warrants carried out on May 8, with three arrests, and a 
hundred and fifty agents on the  prowl in "twelve" cities across America.   
(Different counts in local press reports yielded "thirteen," "fourteen," and 
"sixteen" cities.)   Officials estimated that criminal losses of revenue to 
telephone companies "may run into millions of dollars."   Credit for the 
Sundevil investigations was taken by the US Secret Service, Assistant US 
Attorney Tim Holtzen of Phoenix, and the Assistant Attorney General of 
Arizona,  Gail Thackeray. 
<P>	The prepared remarks of Garry M. Jenkins, appearing in a U.S. 
Department of Justice press release, were of particular interest.  Mr. 
Jenkins was the Assistant Director of the US Secret Service, and the 
highest-ranking federal official to take any direct public role in  the hacker 
crackdown of 1990. 
<P>	"Today, the Secret Service is sending a clear message to those 
computer hackers who have decided to violate the laws of this nation in 
the mistaken belief that they can successfully avoid detection by hiding 
behind the relative anonymity of their computer terminals.(...) 
"Underground groups have been formed for the purpose of exchanging 
information relevant to their criminal activities.  These groups often 
communicate with each other through message systems between 
computers called 'bulletin boards.' "Our experience shows that many 
computer hacker suspects are no longer misguided teenagers, 
mischievously playing games with their computers in their bedrooms.  
Some are now high tech computer operators using computers to engage in 
unlawful conduct." 
<P>	Who were these "underground groups" and "hightech operators?"  
Where had they come from?  What did they want?  Who <I>were</I>   they?  
Were they "mischievous?"  Were they dangerous?  How had "misguided 
teenagers" managed to alarm the United  States Secret Service?  And just 
how widespread was this sort of thing? Of all the major players in the 
Hacker Crackdown: the phone companies, law enforcement, the civil 
libertarians, and the "hackers" themselves -- the "hackers" are by far the 
most mysterious, by far the hardest to understand, by far the <I>weirdest.</I> 
<P>	Not only are "hackers"  novel in their activities, but they come in a 
variety of odd subcultures, with a variety of languages, motives and 
values. 
<P>	The earliest proto-hackers were probably those unsung 
mischievous telegraph boys who were summarily fired by the Bell 
Company in 1878. 
<P>	Legitimate "hackers," those computer enthusiasts who are 
independent-minded but law-abiding, generally trace their spiritual 
ancestry to  elite technical universities, especially M.I.T. and Stanford, in 
the 1960s. 
<P>	But the genuine roots of the modern hacker <I>underground</I> can 
probably be traced most successfully to a now much-obscured hippie 
anarchist movement  known as the Yippies.   The  Yippies, who took their 
name from the largely fictional "Youth International Party," carried out a 
loud and lively policy of surrealistic subversion and outrageous political 
mischief.  Their basic tenets were flagrant sexual promiscuity, open and 
copious drug use, the political overthrow of any powermonger over thirty 
years of age, and an immediate end to the war in Vietnam, by any means 
necessary, including the psychic levitation of the Pentagon. The two most 
visible Yippies were Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.  Rubin eventually  
became a Wall Street broker.  Hoffman, ardently sought by federal 
authorities, went into hiding for seven years, in Mexico, France, and the 
United States.   While on the lam, Hoffman continued to write and 
publish, with help from sympathizers in the American anarcho-leftist 
underground.   Mostly, Hoffman survived through false ID and odd jobs.  
Eventually he underwent facial plastic surgery and adopted an entirely new 
identity as one "Barry Freed."   After surrendering himself to authorities in 
1980, Hoffman  spent a year in prison on a cocaine conviction. 
<P>	Hoffman's worldview grew much darker as the glory days of the 
1960s faded.  In 1989, he purportedly committed suicide, under odd and, 
to some, rather suspicious circumstances. 
<P>	Abbie Hoffman is said to have caused the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to amass the single largest investigation file ever opened on 
an individual American  citizen.  (If this is true, it is still questionable 
whether the FBI regarded Abbie Hoffman a serious public threat  -quite 
possibly, his file was enormous simply because Hoffman left colorful 
legendry wherever he went).   He was a gifted publicist, who regarded 
electronic media as both playground and weapon.  He actively enjoyed 
manipulating network TV and other gullible, imagehungry media,  with 
various weird lies, mindboggling rumors, impersonation scams, and other 
sinister distortions, all absolutely guaranteed to upset cops,  Presidential 
candidates, and federal judges.    Hoffman's most famous work was a book 
self-reflexively known as <I>Steal This Book,</I> which publicized a number 
of methods by which young, penniless hippie agitators might live off  the 
fat of a system supported by humorless drones.  <I>Steal This Book,</I> whose 
title urged readers to damage the very means of distribution which had put 
it into their hands, might be described as a spiritual ancestor of a computer 
virus. 
<P>	Hoffman, like many a later conspirator, made extensive use of pay-
phones for his agitation work -- in his case, generally through the use of 
cheap brass washers as coin-slugs. 
<P>	During the Vietnam War, there was a federal surtax imposed on 
telephone service; Hoffman and his cohorts could, and did,  argue that in 
systematically stealing phone service they were engaging in civil 
disobedience: virtuously denying tax funds to an illegal and immoral war. 
But this thin veil of decency was soon dropped entirely.  Ripping-off the 
System  found its own justification in deep alienation and a basic outlaw 
contempt for  conventional bourgeois values.  Ingenious, vaguely 
politicized varieties of rip-off, which might be described as "anarchy by 
convenience," became very popular in Yippie circles, and because rip-off 
was so useful, it was to survive the Yippie movement itself. In the early 
1970s, it required fairly limited expertise and ingenuity to cheat 
payphones, to divert "free" electricity and gas service, or to rob vending 
machines and parking meters for handy pocket change.   It also required a 
conspiracy to spread this knowledge, and the gall and nerve actually to 
commit petty theft, but the Yippies had these qualifications in plenty.  In 
June 1971, Abbie Hoffman and a telephone enthusiast sarcastically known 
as "Al Bell"  began publishing a newsletter called <I>Youth International 
Party Line.</I>  This newsletter was dedicated to collating and spreading 
Yippie rip-off techniques, especially of phones, to the joy of the 
freewheeling underground and the insensate rage of all straight people. 
<P>	As a political tactic, phone-service theft ensured that Yippie 
advocates would always have ready access to the long-distance telephone 
as a medium, despite the Yippies' chronic lack of organization, discipline, 
money, or even a steady home address. 
<P>	<I>Party Line</I> was run out of Greenwich Village for a couple of 
years, then "Al Bell" more or less defected from the faltering ranks of 
Yippiedom, changing the newsletter's name to <I>TAP</I> or <I>Technical 
Assistance Program.</I>  After the Vietnam War ended, the steam began 
leaking rapidly out of American radical dissent. But  by this time, "Bell" 
and his dozen or so core contributors  had the bit between their teeth, and 
had begun to derive tremendous gut-level satisfaction from the sensation 
of pure <I>technical power.</I> 
<P>	<I>TAP</I> articles, once highly politicized, became pitilessly 
jargonized and technical, in homage or parody to the Bell System's own 
technical documents, which <I>TAP</I> studied closely, gutted, and 
reproduced without permission.   The <I>TAP</I> elite revelled in gloating 
possession of the specialized knowledge necessary to beat the system. 
<P>	"Al Bell" dropped out of the game by the late 70s, and "Tom 
Edison" took over; TAP  readers (some 1400 of them, all told) now began 
to show more interest in telex switches and the growing phenomenon of 
computer systems. In 1983, "Tom Edison" had his computer stolen and his 
house set on fire by an arsonist.  This was an eventually mortal blow to 
<I>TAP</I> (though the legendary name was to be resurrected in 1990 by a 
young Kentuckian computeroutlaw named "Predat0r.")
<P>	Ever since telephones began to make money, there have been 
people willing to rob and defraud phone companies.   The legions of petty 
phone thieves vastly outnumber those "phone phreaks" who  "explore the  
system" for the sake of the intellectual challenge.   The New York 
metropolitan area  (long in the vanguard of American crime) claims over 
150,000 physical attacks on pay telephones every year!  Studied carefully, 
a modern payphone reveals itself as a little fortress, carefully designed and 
redesigned over generations,  to resist coinslugs, zaps of electricity, chunks 
of coin-shaped ice, prybars, magnets, lockpicks, blasting caps.  Public pay-
phones must survive in a world of unfriendly, greedy people,  and a 
modern payphone is as exquisitely evolved as a cactus. 
<P>	Because the phone network pre-dates the computer network, the 
scofflaws known as "phone phreaks" pre-date the scofflaws known as 
"computer hackers."   In practice, today, the line between "phreaking" and 
"hacking" is very blurred, just as the distinction between telephones and 
computers has blurred.  The phone system has been digitized, and 
computers have learned to "talk" over  phone-lines.   What's worse -- and 
this was the point of the Mr. Jenkins of the Secret Service -- some hackers 
have learned to steal, and some thieves have learned to hack. 
<P>	Despite the blurring, one can still draw a few useful behavioral 
distinctions between "phreaks" and "hackers." Hackers are intensely 
interested in the "system" per se, and enjoy relating to machines.  
"Phreaks" are more social,  manipulating the system in a rough-and-ready 
fashion in order to get through to other human beings, fast, cheap and 
under the table. 
<P>	Phone phreaks love nothing so much as "bridges," illegal 
conference calls of ten or twelve chatting conspirators, seaboard to 
seaboard, lasting for many hours -- and running, of course, on somebody 
else's tab, preferably a large corporation's. As phone-phreak conferences 
wear on, people drop out (or simply leave the phone off the hook, while 
they sashay off to work or school or babysitting), and new people are 
phoned up and invited to join in, from some other continent, if possible.  
Technical trivia, boasts, brags, lies, head-trip deceptions, weird rumors, 
and cruel gossip are all freely exchanged. The lowest rung of phone-
phreaking is the theft of telephone access codes.   Charging a phone call to 
somebody else's stolen number is, of course, a pig-easy way of stealing 
phone service, requiring practically no technical expertise.  This practice 
has been very widespread, especially among lonely people without much 
money who are far from home.  Code theft has flourished especially in 
college dorms, military bases, and, notoriously, among roadies for rock 
bands.   Of late, code theft has spread very rapidly among Third Worlders 
in the US, who pile up enormous unpaid long-distance bills to the 
Caribbean, South America, and Pakistan. 
<P>	The simplest way to steal phone-codes is simply to look over a 
victim's shoulder as he punches-in his own code-number on a public 
payphone.  This technique is known as "shoulder-surfing," and is 
especially common in airports, bus terminals, and train stations.  The code 
is  then sold by the thief for a few dollars.  The buyer abusing the code has 
no computer expertise, but calls his Mom in New York,  Kingston or 
Caracas and runs up a huge bill with impunity.  The losses from this 
primitive phreaking activity are far, far greater than the monetary losses 
caused by computer-intruding hackers. In the mid-to-late 1980s, until the 
introduction of sterner telco security measures, <I>computerized</I> code theft 
worked like a charm, and was virtually omnipresent throughout the digital 
underground, among phreaks and hackers alike.   This was accomplished 
through programming one's computer to try random code numbers over 
the telephone until one of them worked. Simple programs to do this were 
widely available in the underground; a computer running all night was 
likely to come up with a dozen or so useful hits.  This could be repeated 
week after week until one had a large library of stolen codes. 
<P>	Nowadays, the computerized dialling of hundreds of numbers can 
be detected within hours and swiftly traced. If a stolen code is repeatedly 
abused, this too can be detected within a few hours.  But for years in the 
1980s, the publication of stolen codes was a kind of elementary etiquette 
for fledgling hackers.   The simplest way to establish your bona-fides as a 
raider was to steal a code through repeated random dialling and offer it to 
the "community" for use.   Codes could be both stolen, and used, simply 
and easily from the safety of one's own bedroom, with very little fear of 
detection or punishment. 
<P>	Before computers and their phone-line modems entered American 
homes in gigantic numbers, phone phreaks had their own special 
telecommunications hardware gadget, the famous "blue box."  This fraud 
device (now rendered increasingly useless by the digital evolution of the 
phone system) could trick switching  systems into granting free access to 
long-distance lines. It did this by mimicking the system's own signal, a 
tone of 2600 hertz. 
<P>	Steven Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the founders of Apple Computer, 
Inc., once dabbled in selling blue-boxes  in college dorms in California.  
For many, in the early days of phreaking, blue-boxing was scarcely 
perceived as "theft," but rather as a fun (if sneaky) way to use excess 
phone capacity harmlessly.  After all, the long-distance lines were <I>just 
sitting there</I>....   Whom did it hurt, really? If you're not <I>damaging</I> the 
system, and  you're not <I>using up any tangible resource,</I> and if nobody 
<I>finds out</I> what you did, then what real harm have you done? What 
exactly <I>have</I> you "stolen," anyway?   If a tree falls in the forest and 
nobody hears it, how much is the noise worth?  Even now this remains a 
rather dicey question. 
<P>	Blue-boxing was no joke to the phone companies, however.  
Indeed, when <I>Ramparts</I> magazine, a radical publication in California, 
printed the wiring schematics necessary to create a  mute box in June 
1972, the magazine was seized by police and Pacific Bell phonecompany 
officials.   The mute box, a blue-box variant, allowed its user to receive 
long-distance calls free of charge to the caller.  This device was closely 
described in a <I>Ramparts</I> article wryly titled "Regulating the Phone 
Company In Your Home."  Publication of this article was held to be in 
violation of Californian State Penal Code section 502.7, which outlaws 
ownership of wire-fraud devices and the selling of "plans or instructions 
for any instrument, apparatus, or device intended to avoid telephone toll 
charges." 
<P>	Issues of <I>Ramparts</I> were recalled or seized on the newsstands, 
and the resultant loss of income helped put the magazine out of business.  
This was an ominous precedent for free-expression issues, but the telco's 
crushing of a radical-fringe magazine passed without serious challenge at 
the time.  Even in the freewheeling California 1970s, it was widely felt 
that there was something sacrosanct about what the phone company knew; 
that the telco had a legal and moral right to protect itself by shutting off the 
flow of such illicit information. Most telco information was so 
"specialized" that it would scarcely be understood by any honest member 
of the public.   If not published, it would not be missed.   To print such 
material did not seem part of the legitimate role of a free press. 
<P>	In 1990 there would be a similar telco-inspired attack on the 
electronic phreak/hacking "magazine" <I>Phrack.</I> The <I>Phrack</I> legal case 
became a central issue in the Hacker Crackdown, and gave rise to great 
controversy. <I>Phrack</I> would also be shut down, for a  time, at least, but 
this time both the telcos and their law-enforcement allies would pay a 
much larger price for their actions.  The <I>Phrack</I> case will be examined 
in detail, later. 
<P>	Phone-phreaking as a social practice is still very much alive at this 
moment.  Today, phone-phreaking is thriving much more vigorously than 
the better-known and worse-feared practice of "computer hacking."  New 
forms of phreaking are spreading rapidly, following new vulnerabilities in 
sophisticated phone services. 
<P>	Cellular phones are especially vulnerable; their chips can be re-
programmed to present a false caller ID and  avoid billing.   Doing so also 
avoids police tapping, making cellular-phone abuse a favorite among drug-
dealers. "Call-sell operations" using pirate cellular phones can, and have, 
been run right out of the backs of cars, which move from "cell" to "cell" in 
the local phone system, retailing stolen long-distance service, like some 
kind of demented electronic version of the neighborhood ice-cream truck. 
<P>	Private branch-exchange phone systems in large corporations can 
be penetrated; phreaks dial-up a local company, enter its internal phone-
system, hack it, then use the company's own PBX system to dial back out 
over the public network, causing the company to be stuck with the 
resulting long-distance bill.  This technique is known as "diverting."  
"Diverting"  can be very costly, especially because phreaks tend to travel 
in packs and never stop talking.   Perhaps the worst by-product of this 
"PBX fraud" is that victim companies and telcos have sued one another 
over the financial responsibility for the stolen calls, thus enriching not only 
shabby phreaks but well-paid lawyers. 
<P>	"Voice-mail systems" can also be abused; phreaks can seize their 
own sections of these sophisticated electronic answering machines, and 
use them for trading codes or knowledge of illegal techniques.   Voice-
mail abuse does not hurt the company directly, but finding supposedly 
empty slots in your company's answering machine all crammed with 
phreaks eagerly chattering and hey-duding one another in impenetrable 
jargon can cause sensations of almost mystical repulsion and dread. 
<P>	Worse yet, phreaks have sometimes been known to react 
truculently to attempts to "clean up" the voice-mail system.  Rather than 
humbly acquiescing to being thrown out of their playground, they may 
very well call up the company officials at work (or at home) and loudly 
demand  free voice-mail addresses of their very own.  Such bullying is 
taken very seriously by spooked victims. 
<P>	Acts of phreak revenge against straight people are rare, but voice-
mail systems are especially tempting and vulnerable, and an infestation of 
angry phreaks in one's voice-mail system is no joke.  They can erase 
legitimate messages; or spy on private messages; or harass users with 
recorded taunts and  obscenities.   They've even been  known to seize 
control of voice-mail security, and lock out legitimate users, or even shut 
down the system entirely. 
<P>	Cellular phone-calls, cordless phones, and ship-toshore telephony 
can all be monitored by various forms of radio; this kind of "passive 
monitoring" is spreading explosively today.  Technically eavesdropping on 
other people's cordless and cellular phone-calls is the fastestgrowing area 
in phreaking today.   This practice strongly appeals to the lust for power 
and conveys gratifying sensations of technical superiority over the 
eavesdropping victim.  Monitoring is rife with all manner of tempting evil 
mischief.  Simple prurient snooping is by far the most common activity.   
But credit-card numbers unwarily spoken over the phone can be recorded, 
stolen and used. And tapping people's phone-calls (whether through active 
telephone taps or passive radio monitors) does lend itself conveniently to 
activities like blackmail, industrial espionage, and political dirty tricks. It 
should be repeated that telecommunications fraud,  the theft of phone 
service,  causes vastly greater monetary losses than the practice of entering 
into computers by stealth.   Hackers are mostly young suburban American 
white males, and exist in their hundreds -- but "phreaks" come from both 
sexes and from many nationalities, ages and ethnic backgrounds, and are 
flourishing in the thousands. 
<P>	The term "hacker" has had an unfortunate history. This book, <I>The 
Hacker Crackdown,</I> has little to say about "hacking" in its finer, original 
sense.  The term  can signify the free-wheeling intellectual exploration of 
the highest and deepest potential of computer systems.   Hacking can 
describe  the determination to make access to computers and information 
as free and open as possible.  Hacking can involve the heartfelt conviction 
that beauty can be found in computers, that the fine aesthetic in a perfect 
program can liberate the mind and spirit.  This is "hacking" as it was 
defined in Steven Levy's much-praised history of the pioneer computer 
milieu, <I>Hackers,</I> published in 1984. 
<P>	Hackers of all kinds are absolutely soaked through with heroic 
anti-bureaucratic sentiment.  Hackers long for recognition as a 
praiseworthy cultural archetype, the postmodern electronic equivalent of 
the cowboy and mountain man.   Whether  they deserve such a reputation 
is something for history to decide.  But many hackers -including those 
outlaw hackers who are computer intruders, and whose activities are 
defined as criminal -actually attempt to <I>live up to</I> this techno-cowboy 
reputation.   And given that electronics and telecommunications are still 
largely unexplored  territories, there is simply <I>no telling</I> what hackers 
might uncover. 
<P>	For some people, this freedom is the very breath of oxygen, the 
inventive spontaneity that makes life worth living  and that flings open 
doors to marvellous possibility and individual empowerment.  But for 
many people -- and increasingly so -- the hacker is an ominous figure, a 
smartaleck sociopath ready to burst out of his basement wilderness and 
savage other people's lives for his own anarchical convenience. 
<P>	Any form of power without responsibility, without direct and 
formal checks and balances, is frightening to people -- and reasonably so.  
It should be frankly admitted that hackers <I>are</I> frightening, and that the 
basis of this fear is not irrational. Fear of hackers goes well beyond the 
fear of merely criminal activity. 
<P>	Subversion and manipulation of the phone system is an act with 
disturbing political overtones.  In America, computers and telephones are 
potent symbols of organized authority and the technocratic business elite.


<P>	But there is an element in American culture that has always 
strongly rebelled  against these symbols; rebelled against all large 
industrial computers and all phone companies.    A certain anarchical tinge 
deep in the American soul delights in causing confusion and pain to all 
bureaucracies, including technological ones. 
<P>	There is sometimes malice and vandalism in this attitude, but it is a 
deep and cherished part of the American national character.  The outlaw, 
the rebel, the rugged individual, the pioneer, the sturdy Jeffersonian 
yeoman, the private citizen resisting interference in his pursuit of 
happiness --  these are figures that all Americans recognize, and that many 
will strongly applaud and defend. 
<P>	Many scrupulously law-abiding citizens today do  cutting-edge 
work with electronics -- work that has already had tremendous social 
influence and will have much more in years to come.    In all truth, these 
talented, hardworking, law-abiding, mature, adult people are far more 
disturbing  to the peace and order of the current status quo  than any 
scofflaw group of romantic teenage punk kids.  These law-abiding hackers  
have the power, ability, and willingness to influence other people's lives 
quite unpredictably.  They have means, motive, and opportunity to meddle 
drastically with the American social  order.    When corralled into 
governments, universities, or large multinational companies, and forced to 
follow rulebooks and wear suits and ties, they at least have some 
conventional halters on their freedom of action.  But when loosed alone, or 
in small groups, and fired by imagination and the entrepreneurial spirit, 
they can move mountains - causing landslides that will likely crash 
directly into your office and living room. 
<P>	These people, as a class, instinctively recognize that a public, 
politicized attack on hackers will eventually spread to them -- that the term 
"hacker,"  once demonized, might be used to knock their hands off the 
levers of power and choke them out of existence.  There are hackers today 
who fiercely and publicly resist any besmirching of the noble title of 
hacker.   Naturally and understandably, they deeply resent the attack on 
their values implicit in using the word "hacker" as a synonym for 
computer-criminal. 
<P>	This book, sadly but in my opinion unavoidably, rather adds to the 
degradation of the term.  It concerns itself mostly with "hacking" in its 
commonest latter-day definition, i.e., intruding into computer systems by 
stealth and without permission. The term "hacking" is used routinely today  
by almost all law enforcement officials with any professional interest in 
computer fraud  and abuse.   American police describe almost any crime 
committed with, by, through, or against a computer as hacking. 
<P>	Most importantly, "hacker" is what computerintruders choose to 
call <I>themselves.</I>  Nobody who "hacks" into systems willingly describes 
himself (rarely, herself) as a "computer intruder," "computer trespasser," 
"cracker," "wormer," "darkside hacker" or "high tech street gangster."   
Several other demeaning terms have been invented  in the hope that the 
press and public will leave the original sense of the word alone.   But few 
people actually use these terms.  (I exempt the term "cyberpunk," which a 
few hackers and law enforcement people actually do use.  The term 
"cyberpunk" is drawn from literary criticism and has some odd  and 
unlikely resonances, but, like hacker, cyberpunk too has become a criminal 
pejorative today.) 
<P>	In any case, breaking into computer systems was hardly alien to the 
original hacker tradition.   The first tottering systems of the 1960s  
required fairly extensive internal surgery merely to function day-by-day.   
Their users "invaded" the deepest, most arcane recesses of their operating 
software almost as a matter of routine. "Computer security" in these early, 
primitive systems was at best an afterthought.  What security there was, 
was entirely physical, for it was assumed that anyone allowed near this 
expensive, arcane hardware would be a fully qualified professional expert. 
<P>	In a campus environment, though, this meant that grad students, 
teaching assistants, undergraduates, and eventually, all manner of dropouts 
and hangers-on ended up accessing and often running the works. 
<P>	Universities, even modern universities, are not in the business of 
maintaining security over information.  On the contrary, universities, as 
institutions, pre-date the "information economy" by many centuries and are 
notfor-profit cultural entities, whose reason for existence (purportedly) is 
to discover truth, codify it through techniques of scholarship, and then 
teach it.   Universities are meant to <I>pass the torch of civilization,</I> not just 
download data into student skulls, and the values of the academic 
community are strongly at odds with those of all would-be information 
empires.   Teachers at all levels, from kindergarten up, have proven to be 
shameless and persistent software and data pirates.   Universities do not 
merely "leak information" but vigorously broadcast free thought. 
<P>	This clash of values has been fraught with controversy.  Many 
hackers of the 1960s remember their professional apprenticeship as a long 
guerilla war against the uptight mainframe-computer "information 
priesthood."  These computer-hungry youngsters had to struggle hard for 
access to computing power, and many of them were not above certain, er, 
shortcuts.   But, over the years,  this practice freed computing from the 
sterile reserve of lab-coated technocrats and was largely responsible for the 
explosive growth of computing in general society -- especially <I>personal</I> 
computing. 
<P>	Access to technical power acted like catnip on certain of these 
youngsters.  Most of the basic techniques of computer intrusion: password 
cracking, trapdoors, backdoors, trojan horses --  were invented in college 
environments in the 1960s, in the early days of network computing.   Some 
off-the-cuff experience at computer intrusion was to be in the informal 
resume of most "hackers" and many future industry giants.   Outside of the 
tiny cult of computer enthusiasts, few people thought much about  the 
implications of "breaking into" computers.  This sort of activity had not 
yet been publicized, much less criminalized. 
<P>	In the 1960s, definitions of "property" and "privacy" had not yet 
been extended to cyberspace.  Computers were not yet indispensable to 
society.  There were no vast databanks of vulnerable, proprietary 
information stored in computers, which might be accessed, copied without 
permission, erased, altered, or sabotaged.   The stakes were low in the 
early days -- but they grew every year, exponentially, as computers 
themselves grew. 
<P>	By the 1990s, commercial and political pressures had become 
overwhelming, and they broke the social boundaries of the hacking 
subculture.   Hacking had become too important to be left to the  hackers.   
Society was now forced to tackle the intangible nature of cyberspace-as-
property, cyberspace as privately-owned unreal-estate.   In the  new, 
severe, responsible, highstakes context of the "Information Society" of the 
1990s, "hacking" was called into question. 
<P>	What did it mean to break into a computer without permission and 
use its computational power, or look around inside its files without hurting 
anything?  What were computer-intruding hackers, anyway -- how should 
society, and the law,  best define their actions?    Were they just 
<I>browsers,</I> harmless intellectual explorers? Were they <I>voyeurs,</I> 
snoops, invaders of privacy?  Should  they be sternly treated as potential 
<I>agents of espionage,</I> or perhaps as <I>industrial spies?</I> Or were they best 
defined as <I>trespassers,</I> a very common teenage misdemeanor?  Was 
hacking  <I>theft of service?</I>  (After all, intruders were getting someone 
else's computer to carry out their orders, without permission and without 
paying).   Was hacking <I>fraud?</I>  Maybe it was best described as 
<I>impersonation.</I>  The commonest mode of computer intrusion was (and 
is) to swipe or snoop somebody else's password, and then enter the 
computer in the guise of another person -- who is commonly stuck with 
the blame and the bills. 
<P>	Perhaps a medical metaphor was better -- hackers should be 
defined as "sick," as <I>computer addicts</I> unable to control their 
irresponsible, compulsive behavior. 
<P>	But these weighty assessments meant little to the people who were 
actually being judged.   From inside the underground world of hacking 
itself,  all these perceptions seem quaint, wrongheaded, stupid, or 
meaningless.   The most important self-perception of underground hackers 
- from the 1960s, right through to the present day --  is that they are an 
<I>elite.</I>  The day-to-day struggle in the underground is not over 
sociological definitions -- who cares? -- but for power, knowledge, and  
status among one's peers. 
<P>	When you are a hacker, it is your own inner conviction of your 
elite status that enables you to break, or let us say "transcend," the rules.   
It is not that <I>all</I> rules go by the board.   The rules habitually broken  by 
hackers are <I>unimportant</I> rules -- the rules of dopey greedhead telco 
bureaucrats and pig-ignorant government pests. Hackers have their <I>own</I> 
rules,  which separate behavior which is cool and elite, from behavior 
which is rodentlike, stupid and losing.   These "rules," however, are mostly 
unwritten and  enforced by peer pressure and tribal feeling.   Like all rules 
that depend on the unspoken conviction that everybody else is a good old 
boy, these rules are ripe for abuse.  The mechanisms of hacker peer-
pressure, "teletrials" and ostracism, are rarely used and rarely work.  Back-
stabbing slander, threats, and electronic harassment are also freely 
employed in downand-dirty intrahacker feuds, but this rarely forces a rival 
out of the scene entirely.  The only real solution for the problem of an 
utterly losing, treacherous and rodentlike hacker is to <I>turn him in to the 
police.</I>   Unlike the Mafia or Medellin Cartel, the hacker elite cannot 
simply execute the bigmouths, creeps and troublemakers among their 
ranks, so they turn one another in with astonishing frequency. 
<P>	There is no tradition of silence or <I>omerta</I> in the hacker 
underworld.     Hackers can be shy, even reclusive, but when they do talk, 
hackers tend to brag, boast and strut.   Almost everything hackers do is 
<I>invisible;</I> if they don't brag, boast, and strut about it, then <I>nobody will 
ever know.</I>  If you don't have something to brag, boast, and strut about, 
then nobody in the underground will recognize you and favor you with 
vital cooperation and respect. 
<P>	The way to win a solid reputation in the underground is by telling 
other hackers things that could only have been learned by exceptional 
cunning and stealth. Forbidden knowledge, therefore, is the basic currency 
of the digital underground, like seashells among Trobriand Islanders.   
Hackers hoard this knowledge, and dwell upon  it obsessively, and refine 
it, and bargain with it, and talk and talk about it. Many hackers even suffer 
from a strange obsession to <I>teach</I> -- to spread the ethos and the 
knowledge of the digital underground.  They'll do this even when it gains 
them no particular advantage and presents a grave personal risk. 
<P>	And when that risk catches up with them, they will go right on 
teaching and preaching -- to a new audience this time, their interrogators 
from law enforcement.   Almost every hacker arrested tells everything he 
knows --  all about his friends, his mentors, his disciples -- legends, 
threats, horror stories, dire rumors, gossip, hallucinations. This is, of 
course, convenient for law enforcement -- except when law enforcement 
begins to believe hacker legendry. 
<P>	Phone phreaks are unique among criminals in their willingness to 
call up law enforcement officials -- in the office, at their homes -- and give 
them an extended piece of their mind.  It is hard not to interpret this as 
<I>begging for arrest,</I> and in fact it is an act of incredible foolhardiness.  
Police are naturally nettled by these acts of chutzpah and will go well out 
of their way to bust these flaunting idiots.   But it can also be interpreted as 
a product of a world-view so elitist, so closed and hermetic, that electronic 
police are simply  not perceived as "police," but rather as <I>enemy phone 
phreaks</I> who should be scolded into behaving "decently." 
<P>	Hackers at their most grandiloquent perceive themselves as the 
elite pioneers of a new electronic world. Attempts to make them obey the 
democratically established laws of contemporary American society are 
seen as repression and persecution.   After all, they argue, if Alexander 
Graham Bell had gone along with the rules of the Western Union telegraph 
company, there would have been no telephones.  If Jobs and Wozniak had 
believed that IBM was the be-all and end-all, there would have been no 
personal computers.  If Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson had tried 
to "work within the system" there would have been no United States. 
<P>	Not only do hackers privately believe this as an  article of faith, but 
they have been known to write ardent manifestos about it.  Here are some 
revealing excerpts from an especially vivid hacker manifesto:  "The 
TechnoRevolution" by  "Dr. Crash,"  which appeared in electronic form in 
<I>Phrack</I> Volume 1, Issue 6, Phile 3. 
<P>	"To fully explain the true motives behind hacking, we  must first 
take a quick look into the past.  In the 1960s, a group of MIT students built 
the first modern computer system.  This wild, rebellious group of young 
men were the first to bear the name 'hackers.'  The systems that they 
developed were intended to be used to solve world problems and to benefit 
all of mankind. 
<P>	"As we can see, this has not been the case.  The computer system 
has been solely in the hands of big businesses and the government.  The 
wonderful device meant to enrich life has become a weapon which 
dehumanizes people.  To the government and large businesses, people are 
no more than disk space, and the government doesn't use computers to 
arrange aid for the poor, but to control nuclear death weapons.  The 
average American can only have access to a small microcomputer  which 
is worth only a fraction of what they pay for it.  The businesses keep the 
true state-of-the-art equipment away from the people behind a steel wall of 
incredibly high prices and bureaucracy.  It is because of this state of affairs 
that hacking was born.(...) 
<P>	"Of course, the government doesn't want the monopoly of 
technology broken, so they have outlawed hacking and arrest anyone who 
is caught.(...) The phone company is another example of technology 
abused and kept from people with high prices.(...) 
<P>	"Hackers often find that their existing equipment, due to the 
monopoly tactics of computer companies, is  inefficient for their purposes.  
Due to the exorbitantly high prices, it is impossible to legally purchase the 
necessary equipment.  This need has given still another segment of the 
fight:  Credit Carding.  Carding is a way of obtaining the necessary goods 
without paying for them.  It is again due to the companies' stupidity that 
Carding is so easy, and shows that the world's businesses are in the hands 
of those with considerably less technical know-how than we, the hackers. 
(...) "Hacking must continue.  We must train newcomers to the art of 
hacking.(....)  And whatever you do, continue  the fight.  Whether you 
know it or not, if you are a hacker, you are a revolutionary.  Don't worry, 
you're on the right side." 
<P>	The  defense of "carding" is rare.  Most hackers regard credit-card 
theft as "poison" to the underground, a sleazy and immoral effort that, 
worse yet, is hard to get away with.   Nevertheless, manifestos advocating 
creditcard theft, the deliberate crashing of computer systems, and even acts 
of violent physical destruction such as vandalism and arson do exist in the 
underground.  These boasts and threats are taken quite seriously by the 
police. And not every hacker is an abstract, Platonic computernerd.  Some 
few are quite experienced at picking locks, robbing phone-trucks, and 
breaking and entering buildings. 
<P>	Hackers  vary in their degree of hatred for authority and the 
violence of their rhetoric.  But, at a bottom line, they are scofflaws.  They 
don't regard the current rules of electronic behavior as respectable efforts 
to preserve law and order and protect public safety.  They regard these 
laws as immoral efforts by soulless corporations to protect their profit 
margins and to crush dissidents.   "Stupid" people, including police, 
businessmen, politicians, and journalists, simply have no right to judge the 
actions of those possessed of genius, techno-revolutionary intentions, and 
technical expertise. 
<P>	Hackers are generally teenagers and college kids not engaged in 
earning a living.   They often come from fairly well-to-do middle-class 
backgrounds, and are markedly anti-materialistic (except, that is, when it 
comes to computer equipment).   Anyone motivated by greed for mere 
money (as opposed to the greed for power, knowledge and status)  is 
swiftly written-off as a narrowminded breadhead whose interests can only 
be corrupt and contemptible.
<P>	Having grown up in the 1970s and 1980s, the young Bohemians of 
the digital underground regard straight society as awash in plutocratic 
corruption, where everyone from the President down is for sale and 
whoever has the gold makes the rules. 
<P>	Interestingly, there's a funhouse-mirror image of this attitude on the 
other side of the conflict.  The police are also one of the most markedly 
anti-materialistic groups in American society, motivated not by mere 
money but by  ideals of service, justice, esprit-de-corps, and, of course, 
their own brand of specialized knowledge and power. Remarkably, the 
propaganda war between cops and hackers has always involved angry 
allegations that the other side is trying to make a sleazy buck.  Hackers 
consistently sneer that anti-phreak prosecutors are angling for cushy jobs 
as telco lawyers and that computercrime police are aiming to cash in later 
as well-paid computer-security consultants in the private sector. 
<P>	For their part, police publicly conflate all hacking crimes with 
robbing payphones with crowbars.  Allegations of "monetary losses" from 
computer intrusion are notoriously inflated.  The act of illicitly copying a 
document from a computer is morally equated with  directly robbing a 
company of, say, half a million dollars. The teenage computer intruder in 
possession of this "proprietary"  document has certainly not sold it for such 
a sum, would likely have little idea how to sell it at all, and quite probably 
doesn't even understand what he has.  He has not made a cent in profit 
from his felony but is still morally equated with a thief who has robbed the 
church poorbox and lit out for Brazil. 
<P>	Police want to believe that all hackers are thieves. It is a tortuous 
and almost unbearable act for the American justice system to put people in 
jail because they want to learn things which are forbidden for them to 
know.   In an American context, almost any pretext for punishment is 
better than jailing people to protect certain restricted kinds of information.  
Nevertheless, <I>policing information</I> is part and parcel of the struggle 
against hackers. 
<P>	This dilemma is well exemplified by the remarkable activities of 
"Emmanuel Goldstein," editor and publisher of a print magazine known as 
<I>2600: The Hacker Quarterly.</I>  Goldstein was an English major at Long 
Island's State University of New York in the '70s, when he became 
involved with the local college radio station.  His growing interest in 
electronics caused him to drift into Yippie <I>TAP</I> circles and thus into the 
digital underground, where he became a self-described technorat.  His 
magazine publishes techniques of computer intrusion and telephone 
"exploration" as well as gloating exposes of telco misdeeds and 
governmental failings. 
<P>	Goldstein lives quietly and very privately in a large, crumbling 
Victorian mansion in Setauket, New York.   The seaside house is 
decorated with telco decals, chunks of driftwood, and the basic bric-a-brac 
of a hippie crash-pad. He is unmarried, mildly unkempt, and survives 
mostly on TV dinners and turkey-stuffing eaten straight out of the bag.   
Goldstein is a man of considerable charm and fluency, with a brief, 
disarming smile and the kind of pitiless, stubborn, thoroughly recidivist 
integrity that America's electronic police find genuinely alarming. 
<P>	Goldstein took his nom-de-plume, or "handle," from a character in 
Orwell's <I>1984,</I>  which may be taken,  correctly, as a symptom of the 
gravity of his sociopolitical worldview.   He is not himself a practicing 
computer intruder, though he vigorously abets these actions, especially 
when they are pursued against large  corporations or governmental 
agencies.   Nor is he a thief, for he loudly scorns mere theft of phone 
service, in favor of 'exploring and manipulating the system.'  He is 
probably best described and understood as a <I>dissident.</I> 

<P>	Weirdly, Goldstein is living in modern America under conditions 
very similar to those of former East European intellectual dissidents.  In 
other words, he flagrantly espouses a value-system that is deeply and 
irrevocably opposed to the system of those in power and  the police.  The 
values in <I>2600</I> are generally expressed in terms that are ironic, sarcastic, 
paradoxical, or just downright confused.  But there's no mistaking their 
radically anti-authoritarian tenor.  <I>2600</I> holds that technical power and 
specialized knowledge, of any kind obtainable, belong by right in the 
hands of those individuals brave and bold enough to discover them -- by 
whatever means necessary.  Devices, laws, or systems that forbid access, 
and the free spread of knowledge, are provocations that any free and self-
respecting hacker should relentlessly attack.  The "privacy" of 
governments, corporations and other soulless technocratic organizations 
should never be protected at the expense of the liberty and free initiative of 
the individual techno-rat. 
<P>	However, in our contemporary workaday world,  both governments 
and corporations are very anxious indeed to  police information which is 
secret, proprietary, restricted, confidential, copyrighted, patented, 
hazardous, illegal, unethical, embarrassing, or otherwise sensitive.   This 
makes Goldstein persona non grata, and his philosophy a threat. 
<P>	Very little about the conditions of Goldstein's daily life would 
astonish, say, Vaclav Havel.  (We may note in passing that President 
Havel once had his word-processor confiscated by the Czechoslovak 
police.)   Goldstein lives by <I>samizdat,</I> acting semi-openly as a data-
center for the underground, while challenging the powers-that-be to abide 
by their own stated rules:  freedom of speech and the First Amendment. 
<P>	Goldstein thoroughly looks and acts the part of techno-rat, with 
shoulder-length ringlets and a piratical black fisherman's-cap set at a 
rakish angle.  He often shows up like Banquo's ghost at meetings of 
computer professionals, where he listens quietly, half-smiling and taking 
thorough notes. 
<P>	Computer professionals generally meet publicly,  and find it very 
difficult to rid themselves of Goldstein and his ilk  without extralegal and 
unconstitutional actions. Sympathizers, many of them quite respectable 
people with responsible jobs, admire Goldstein's attitude and 
surreptitiously pass him information.  An unknown but presumably large 
proportion of Goldstein's  2,000-plus readership are telco security 
personnel and police, who  are forced to subscribe to <I>2600</I>  to stay 
abreast of new developments in hacking.  They thus find themselves 
<I>paying this guy's rent</I> while grinding their teeth in anguish, a situation 
that would have delighted Abbie Hoffman (one of Goldstein's few idols). 
<P>	Goldstein is probably the best-known public representative of the 
hacker underground today, and certainly the best-hated.  Police regard him 
as a Fagin, a corrupter of youth, and speak of him with untempered 
loathing.  He is quite an accomplished gadfly. 
<P>	After the  Martin Luther King Day Crash of 1990,  Goldstein, for 
instance, adeptly rubbed salt into the wound in the pages of <I>2600.</I>   
"Yeah, it was fun for the phone phreaks as we watched the network 
crumble," he admitted cheerfully.   "But it was also an ominous sign of 
what's to come...  Some AT&amp;T people, aided by well-meaning but 
ignorant media, were spreading the notion that many companies had the 
same software and therefore could face the same problem someday.  
Wrong.  This was entirely an AT&amp;T software deficiency.  Of course, other 
companies could face entirely <I>different</I> software problems.  But then, so 
too could AT&amp;T." 
<P>	After a technical discussion of the system's failings, the Long 
Island techno-rat went on to offer thoughtful criticism to the gigantic 
multinational's hundreds of professionally qualified engineers.  "What we 
don't know is how a major force in communications like AT&amp;T could be 
so sloppy.  What happened to backups?  Sure, computer systems go down 
all the time, but people  making phone calls are not the same as people 
logging on to computers.  We must make that distinction.  It's not 
acceptable for the phone system or any other essential service to 'go down.'  
If we continue to trust technology without understanding it, we can look 
forward to many variations on this theme. 
<P>	"AT&amp;T owes it to its customers to be prepared to <I>instantly</I> 
switch to another network if something strange  and unpredictable starts 
occurring.  The news here isn't so much the failure of a computer program, 
but the failure of AT&amp;T's entire structure." 
<P>	The very idea of this.... this <I>person</I>....  offering "advice" about 
"AT&amp;T's entire structure" is more than some people can easily bear.   How 
dare this near-criminal dictate what is or isn't "acceptable" behavior from 
AT&amp;T? Especially when he's publishing, in the very same issue, detailed 
schematic diagrams for creating various switching-network signalling 
tones unavailable to the public. 

<P>	"See what happens when you drop a 'silver box' tone or two down 
your local exchange or through different long distance service carriers," 
advises <I>2600</I> contributor "Mr. Upsetter" in "How To Build a Signal 
Box."  "If you experiment systematically and keep good records, you will 
surely discover something interesting." 
<P>	This is, of course, the scientific method, generally regarded as a 
praiseworthy activity and one of the flowers of modern civilization.   One 
can indeed learn a great deal with this sort of structured intellectual 
activity.   Telco employees regard this mode of "exploration" as akin to 
flinging sticks of dynamite into their pond to see what lives on the bottom. 
<P>	<I>2600</I> has been published consistently since 1984.  It has also run 
a bulletin board computer system, printed <I>2600</I> T-shirts, taken fax 
calls...  The Spring 1991 issue has an interesting announcement on page 
45:  "We just discovered an extra set of wires attached to our fax line and 
heading up the pole.  (They've since been clipped.) Your faxes to us and to 
anyone else could be monitored." 

<P>	In the worldview of <I>2600,</I> the tiny band of technorat brothers 
(rarely, sisters) are a beseiged vanguard of the truly free and honest.   The 
rest of the world is a maelstrom of corporate crime and high-level 
governmental corruption, occasionally tempered with well-meaning 
ignorance.   To read a few issues in a row is to enter a nightmare akin to 
Solzhenitsyn's, somewhat tempered by the fact that <I>2600</I> is often 
extremely funny. 
<P>	Goldstein did not become a target of the Hacker Crackdown, 
though he protested loudly, eloquently, and publicly about it, and it added 
considerably to his fame. It was not that he is not regarded as dangerous, 
because he is so regarded.  Goldstein has had brushes with the law in the 
past:  in 1985, a <I>2600</I> bulletin board computer was seized by the FBI, 
and some software on it was formally declared "a burglary tool in the form 
of a computer program."  But Goldstein escaped direct repression in 1990, 
because his magazine is printed on paper, and recognized as subject to 
Constitutional freedom of the  press protection.  As was seen in the 
<I>Ramparts</I> case, this is far from an absolute guarantee.  Still, as a 
practical matter, shutting down <I>2600</I> by court-order would create so 
much legal hassle that it is simply unfeasible, at least for the present.   
Throughout 1990, both Goldstein and his magazine were peevishly 
thriving. 
<P>	Instead, the Crackdown of 1990 would concern itself with the 
computerized version of forbidden data.  The crackdown itself, first and 
foremost, was about <I>bulletin board systems.</I>  Bulletin Board Systems, 
most often known by the ugly and un-pluralizable acronym "BBS," are the 
life-blood of the digital underground.  Boards were also central to law 
enforcement's tactics and strategy in the Hacker Crackdown. 
<P>	A "bulletin board system" can be formally defined as a computer 
which serves as an information and messagepassing center for users 
dialing-up over the phone-lines through the use of  modems.   A "modem," 
or modulatordemodulator, is a device which translates the digital impulses 
of computers into audible analog telephone signals, and vice versa.   
Modems connect computers to phones and thus to each other. 
<P>	Large-scale mainframe computers have been connected since the 
1960s, but <I>personal</I> computers, run by individuals out of their homes, 
were first networked in the late 1970s.   The "board" created by Ward 
Christensen and Randy Suess in February 1978, in Chicago, Illinois, is 
generally regarded as the first personal-computer bulletin board system 
worthy of the name. Boards run on many different machines, employing 
many different kinds of software.  Early boards were crude and buggy, and 
their managers, known as "system operators" or "sysops," were hard-
working technical experts who wrote their own software.  But like most  
everything else in the world of electronics, boards became faster, cheaper, 
better-designed, and generally far more sophisticated throughout the 
1980s.  They also moved swiftly out of the hands of pioneers and into 
those of the general public.   By 1985 there were something in the 
neighborhood of 4,000 boards in America.  By 1990 it was calculated, 
vaguely, that there were about 30,000 boards in the US, with uncounted 
thousands overseas. 
<P>	Computer bulletin boards are unregulated enterprises.  Running a 
board is a rough-and-ready, catchas-catch-can proposition.   Basically,  
anybody with a computer, modem, software and a phone-line can start a 
board.   With second-hand equipment and public-domain free software, the 
price of a board might be quite small -less than it would take to publish a 
magazine or even a decent pamphlet.   Entrepreneurs eagerly sell bulletin-
board software, and will coach nontechnical amateur sysops in its use. 
<P>	Boards are not "presses."  They are not magazines, or libraries, or 
phones, or CB radios, or traditional cork bulletin boards down at the local 
laundry, though they have some passing resemblance to those earlier 
media. Boards are a new medium -- they may even be a <I>large number</I> of 
new media. 
<P>	Consider these unique characteristics:  boards are cheap, yet they  
can have a national, even global reach. Boards can be contacted from 
anywhere in the global telephone network, at <I>no cost</I> to the person 
running the board -- the caller pays the phone bill, and if the caller is local, 
the call is free.  Boards do not involve an editorial elite addressing a mass 
audience.   The "sysop" of a board is not an exclusive publisher or writer -- 
he is managing an electronic salon, where individuals can address the 
general public,  play the part of the general public, and also  exchange 
private mail with other individuals.  And the "conversation" on boards, 
though fluid, rapid, and  highly interactive, is not spoken, but written.  It is 
also relatively anonymous, sometimes completely so. 
<P>	And because boards are cheap and ubiquitous, regulations and 
licensing requirements would likely be practically unenforceable.  It would 
almost be easier to "regulate"  "inspect" and "license" the content of 
private mail -- probably more so, since the mail system is operated by the 
federal government.  Boards are run by individuals, independently, entirely 
at their own whim. 
<P>	For the sysop, the cost of operation is not the primary limiting 
factor.  Once the investment in a computer and modem has been made, the 
only steady cost is the charge for maintaining a phone line (or several 
phone lines).   The primary limits for sysops are time and energy.  Boards 
require upkeep.  New users are generally "validated" -they must be issued 
individual passwords, and called at home by voice-phone, so that their 
identity can be verified.  Obnoxious users, who exist in plenty, must be 
chided or purged.  Proliferating messages must be deleted when they grow 
old, so that the capacity of the system is not overwhelmed.  And software 
programs (if such things are kept on the board)  must be examined for 
possible computer viruses.   If there is a financial charge to use the board 
(increasingly common, especially in larger and fancier systems) then 
accounts must be kept, and users must be billed.  And if the board crashes 
-- a very common occurrence -- then repairs must be made. 
<P>	Boards can be distinguished by the amount of effort spent in 
regulating them.  First, we have the completely open board, whose sysop is 
off chugging brews and watching re-runs while his users generally 
degenerate over time into peevish anarchy and eventual silence. Second 
comes the supervised board, where the sysop breaks in every once in a 
while to tidy up, calm brawls, issue announcements, and rid the 
community of  dolts and troublemakers.   Third is the heavily supervised  
board,  which sternly urges adult and responsible behavior and swiftly 
edits any message considered offensive, impertinent, illegal or irrelevant.  
And last comes the completely  edited "electronic publication,"  which is 
presented to a silent audience which is not allowed to respond directly in 
any way. 
<P>	Boards can also be grouped by their degree of anonymity.  There is 
the completely anonymous board, where everyone uses pseudonyms -- 
"handles" -- and even  the sysop is unaware of the user's true identity.  The 
sysop himself is likely pseudonymous on a board of this type. Second, and 
rather more common, is the board where the sysop knows (or thinks he 
knows) the true names and addresses of all users, but the users don't know 
one another's names and may not know his.  Third is the board where 
everyone has to use real names, and roleplaying and pseudonymous 
posturing are forbidden. 
<P>	Boards can be grouped by their immediacy.  "Chatlines" are boards 
linking several users together over several different phone-lines 
simultaneously, so that people exchange messages at the very moment that 
they  type.  (Many large boards feature "chat" capabilities along with other 
services.)   Less immediate boards, perhaps with a single phoneline, store 
messages serially, one at a time.  And some boards are only open for 
business in daylight hours or on weekends, which greatly slows response.  
A <I>network</I> of boards, such as "FidoNet," can carry electronic mail from 
board to board, continent to continent, across huge distances -- but at a 
relative snail's pace, so that a message can take several days to reach its 
target audience and elicit a reply. 
<P>	Boards can be grouped by their degree of community.  Some 
boards emphasize the exchange of private, person-to-person electronic 
mail.   Others emphasize public postings and may even purge people  who 
"lurk," merely reading posts but refusing to openly participate.  Some 
boards are intimate and neighborly. Others are frosty and highly technical.  
Some are little more than storage dumps for software, where users 
"download" and "upload" programs, but interact among themselves little if 
at all. 
<P>	Boards can be grouped by their ease of access.  Some boards are 
entirely public.  Others are private and restricted only to personal friends 
of the sysop.   Some boards divide users by status.   On these boards, some 
users, especially beginners, strangers or children, will be  restricted to 
general topics, and perhaps forbidden to post. Favored users, though, are 
granted the ability to post as they please, and to stay "on-line" as long as 
they like, even to the disadvantage of other people trying to call in.  High-
status users can be given access to hidden areas in the board, such as off-
color topics, private discussions, and/or valuable software.  Favored users 
may even become "remote sysops" with the power to take remote control 
of the board through their own home computers.  Quite often "remote 
sysops" end up doing all the work and  taking formal control of the 
enterprise, despite the fact that it's physically located in someone else's 
house. Sometimes several "co-sysops" share power. 
<P>	And boards can also be grouped by size.  Massive, nationwide 
commercial networks, such as CompuServe, Delphi, GEnie and Prodigy, 
are run on mainframe computers and are generally not considered 
"boards," though they share many of their characteristics, such as 
electronic mail, discussion topics, libraries of software, and persistent and 
growing problems with civil-liberties issues. Some private boards have as 
many as thirty phone-lines and quite sophisticated hardware.   And then 
there are tiny boards. 
<P>	Boards vary in popularity.  Some boards are huge and crowded, 
where users must claw their way in against a constant busy-signal.  Others 
are huge and empty -- there are few things sadder than a formerly 
flourishing board where no one posts any longer, and the dead 
conversations of vanished users lie about gathering digital dust.  Some 
boards are tiny and intimate, their telephone numbers intentionally kept 
confidential so that only a small number can log on. 
<P>	And some boards are <I>underground.</I> 
<P>	Boards can be mysterious entities.  The activities of their users can 
be hard to differentiate from conspiracy. Sometimes they <I>are</I> 
conspiracies.  Boards have harbored, or have been accused of harboring, 
all manner of fringe groups, and have abetted, or been accused of abetting, 
every manner of frowned-upon, sleazy, radical, and criminal activity.   
There are Satanist boards.  Nazi boards.  Pornographic boards.  Pedophile 
boards.  Drugdealing boards.  Anarchist boards.  Communist boards. Gay 
and Lesbian boards (these exist in great profusion,  many of them quite 
lively with well-established histories). Religious cult boards.  Evangelical 
boards.  Witchcraft boards, hippie boards, punk boards, skateboarder 
boards. Boards for UFO believers.   There may well be boards for serial 
killers, airline terrorists and professional assassins. There is simply no way 
to tell.   Boards spring up, flourish, and disappear in large numbers, in 
most every corner of the developed world.  Even apparently innocuous 
public boards can, and sometimes do, harbor secret areas known only to a 
few.  And even on the vast, public, commercial  services, private mail is 
very private -- and quite possibly criminal. 
<P>	Boards cover most every topic imaginable and some that are hard 
to imagine.  They cover a vast spectrum of social activity.   However, all 
board users do have something in common:  their possession of computers 
and phones.  Naturally, computers and phones are primary topics of 
conversation on almost every board. 
<P>	And hackers and phone phreaks, those utter devotees of computers 
and phones, live by boards.  They swarm by boards.  They are bred by 
boards.  By the late 1980s, phone-phreak groups and hacker groups, united 
by boards, had proliferated fantastically. 
<P>	As evidence, here
is a list of hacker groups compiled by the editors 
of <I>Phrack</I> on August 8, 1988.

<P>	Contemplating this list is  an impressive, almost humbling 
business.   As a cultural artifact, the thing approaches poetry. 
<P>	Underground groups -- subcultures -- can be distinguished from 
independent cultures by their  habit of referring constantly to the parent 
society.  Undergrounds by their nature constantly  must maintain a 
membrane of differentiation.   Funny/distinctive clothes and hair, 
specialized jargon, specialized ghettoized areas in cities, different hours of 
rising, working, sleeping....  The digital underground, which specializes in 
information, relies very heavily on language to distinguish itself.   As can 
be seen from this list, they make heavy use of parody and mockery.   It's 
revealing to see who they choose to mock. 
<P>	First,  large corporations.  We have the Phortune 500, The Chief 
Executive Officers,  Bellcore,  IBM Syndicate, SABRE (a computerized 
reservation service maintained by airlines).  The common use of "Inc." is 
telling -- none of these groups are actual corporations, but take clear 
delight in mimicking them. 
<P>	Second,  governments and police.  NASA Elite, NATO 
Association.  "Feds R Us" and "Secret Service" are fine bits of fleering 
boldness.  OSS -- the Office of Strategic Services was the forerunner of 
the CIA. 
<P>	Third, criminals.  Using stigmatizing pejoratives as a perverse 
badge of honor is a time-honored tactic for subcultures:   punks, gangs, 
delinquents, mafias, pirates, bandits, racketeers. 
<P>	Specialized orthography, especially the use of "ph" for "f" and "z" 
for the plural "s," are instant recognition symbols.  So is the use of the 
numeral "0" for the letter "O" -- computer-software orthography generally 
features a slash through the zero, making the distinction obvious. 
<P>	Some terms are poetically descriptive of computer intrusion:  the 
Stowaways,  the Hitchhikers, the PhoneLine Phantoms, Coast-to-Coast.  
Others are simple bravado and vainglorious puffery.  (Note the insistent 
use of the terms "elite" and "master.")  Some terms are blasphemous, some 
obscene, others merely cryptic - anything to puzzle, offend, confuse, and 
keep the straights at bay. 
<P>	Many hacker groups further re-encrypt their names by the use of 
acronyms:  United Technical Underground becomes UTU, Farmers of 
Doom become FoD,  the United SoftWareZ Force becomes, at its own 
insistence, "TuSwF," and woe to the ignorant rodent who capitalizes the 
wrong letters. 
<P>	It should be further recognized that the members of these groups 
are themselves pseudonymous.  If you did, in fact, run across the 
"PhoneLine Phantoms," you would find them to consist of  "Carrier 
Culprit,"  "The Executioner," "Black Majik,"  "Egyptian Lover,"  "Solid 
State," and  "Mr Icom."  "Carrier Culprit" will likely be referred to by his 
friends as "CC," as in, "I got these dialups from CC of PLP." 
<P>	It's quite possible that this entire list refers to as few as a thousand 
people.   It is not a complete list of underground groups -- there has never 
been such a list, and there never will be.   Groups rise, flourish, decline, 
share membership, maintain a cloud of wannabes and casual hangers-on.  
People pass in and out, are ostracized, get bored, are busted by police, or 
are cornered by telco security and presented with huge bills.  Many 
"underground groups" are software pirates, "warez d00dz," who might 
break copy protection and pirate programs, but likely wouldn't dare to 
intrude on a computer-system. It is hard to estimate the true population of 
the digital underground.  There is constant turnover.  Most hackers start 
young, come and go, then drop out at age 22 -- the age of college 
graduation.  And a large majority of "hackers" access pirate boards, adopt 
a handle,  swipe software and perhaps abuse a phone-code or two, while 
never actually joining the elite. 
<P>	Some professional informants, who make it their business to retail 
knowledge of the underground to paymasters in private corporate security, 
have estimated the hacker population at as high as fifty thousand.   This is 
likely highly inflated, unless one counts every single teenage software 
pirate  and petty phone-booth thief.  My best guess is about 5,000 people.   
Of these, I would guess that as few as a hundred are truly "elite"  -- active 
computer intruders, skilled enough to penetrate sophisticated systems and 
truly to worry corporate security and law enforcement. 
<P>	Another interesting speculation is whether this group is growing or 
not.  Young teenage hackers are often convinced that hackers exist in vast 
swarms and will soon dominate the cybernetic universe.  Older and wiser 
veterans, perhaps as wizened as 24 or 25 years old, are convinced that the 
glory days are long gone, that the cops have the underground's number 
now, and that kids these days are dirt-stupid and just want to play 
Nintendo. 
<P>	My own assessment is that computer intrusion, as a non-profit act 
of intellectual exploration and mastery, is in slow decline, at least in the 
United States; but that electronic fraud, especially telecommunication 
crime, is growing by leaps and bounds. 
<P>	One might find a useful parallel to the digital underground in  the 
drug  underground.   There was a time, now much-obscured by historical 
revisionism, when Bohemians freely shared joints at concerts, and hip, 
smallscale marijuana dealers might turn people on just for the sake of 
enjoying a long stoned conversation about the Doors and Allen Ginsberg.  
Now drugs are increasingly verboten, except in a high-stakes, highly-
criminal world of highly addictive drugs.  Over years of disenchantment 
and police harassment, a vaguely ideological, free-wheeling drug 
underground has relinquished the business of drugdealing to a  far more 
savage criminal hard-core.   This is not a pleasant prospect to contemplate, 
but the analogy is fairly compelling. 
<P>	What does an underground board look like?   What distinguishes it 
from a standard board?  It isn't necessarily the conversation -- hackers 
often talk about common board topics, such as hardware, software, sex, 
science fiction, current events, politics, movies, personal gossip. 
Underground boards can best be distinguished by their files, or "philes,"  
pre-composed texts which teach the techniques and ethos of the 
underground.   These are prized reservoirs of forbidden knowledge.  Some 
are anonymous, but most proudly bear the handle of the  "hacker" who has 
created them, and his group affiliation, if he has one.
Here is a partial 
table-of-contents of philes from an underground board, somewhere in the 
heart of middle America, circa 1991.  The descriptions are mostly self-
explanatory.

<HR>
<P>	<I>Holy Cow!</I>  The damned thing is full of stuff about bombs! 
<P>	What are we to make of this? 
<P>	First, it should be acknowledged that spreading knowledge about 
demolitions to teenagers is a highly and deliberately antisocial act.
<P>	It is not, however, illegal. 
<P>	Second, it should be recognized that most of these philes were in 
fact <I>written</I> by teenagers.  Most adult American males who can 
remember their teenage years will recognize that the notion of building a 
flamethrower in your garage is an incredibly neat-o idea.  <I>Actually</I> 
building a flamethrower in your garage, however, is fraught with 
discouraging difficulty.  Stuffing gunpowder into a booby-trapped 
flashlight, so as to blow the arm off your high-school vice-principal, can 
be a thing of dark beauty to contemplate.   Actually committing assault by 
explosives  will earn you the sustained attention of the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
<P>	Some people, however, will actually try these plans.  A 
determinedly murderous American teenager can probably buy or steal a 
handgun far more easily than he can brew fake "napalm" in the kitchen 
sink.  Nevertheless, if temptation is spread before people a certain number 
will succumb, and a small minority will actually attempt these stunts.  A 
large minority of that small minority will either fail or, quite likely, maim 
themselves, since these "philes" have not been checked for accuracy, are 
not the product of professional experience, and are often highly fanciful.  
But the gloating menace of these philes is not to be entirely dismissed. 
<P>	Hackers may not be "serious" about bombing; if they were, we 
would hear far more about exploding flashlights, homemade bazookas, 
and gym teachers poisoned by chlorine and potassium.  However, hackers 
are <I>very</I> serious about forbidden knowledge.  They are possessed  not 
merely by curiosity, but by a positive <I>lust to know.</I> The desire to know 
what others don't is scarcely new.  But the <I>intensity</I> of this desire, as 
manifested by these young technophilic denizens of the Information Age, 
may in fact <I>be</I> new, and may represent some basic shift in social values 
-- a harbinger of what the world may come to, as society lays more and 
more value on the possession, assimilation and retailing of <I>information</I> 
as a basic commodity of daily life. 
<P>	There have always been young men with obsessive interests in 
these topics.  Never before, however, have they been able to network so 
extensively and easily, and to propagandize their interests with impunity to 
random passers-by.   High-school teachers will recognize that there's 
always one in a crowd, but when the one in a crowd escapes control by 
jumping into the phone-lines, and becomes a hundred such kids all 
together on a board, then trouble is brewing visibly.  The urge of authority 
to <I>do something,</I>  even something drastic, is hard to resist. And in 1990, 
authority did something.  In fact authority did a great deal. 



<P>	The process by which boards create hackers goes something like 
this.  A youngster becomes interested in computers -- usually, computer 
games.  He hears from friends that "bulletin boards" exist where games 
can be obtained for free.  (Many computer games are "freeware," not 
copyrighted -- invented simply for the love of it and given away to the 
public; some of these games are quite good.)  He bugs his parents for a 
modem, or quite often, uses his parents' modem. 

<P>	The world of boards suddenly opens up.  Computer games can be 
quite expensive, real budget-breakers for a kid, but pirated games, stripped 
of copy protection,  are cheap or free.  They are also illegal, but it is very 
rare, almost unheard of, for a small-scale software pirate to be prosecuted.  
Once "cracked" of its copy protection, the program, being digital data, 
becomes infinitely reproducible.  Even the instructions to the game, any 
manuals that accompany it, can be reproduced as text files, or photocopied 
from legitimate sets.  Other users  on boards can give many useful hints in 
game-playing tactics. And a youngster with an infinite supply of free 
computer games can certainly cut quite a swath among his modemless 
friends. And boards are pseudonymous.  No one need know that you're 
fourteen years old -- with a little practice at subterfuge, you can talk to 
adults about adult things, and be accepted and taken seriously!  You can 
even pretend to be a girl, or an old man, or anybody you can imagine.  If 
you find this kind of deception gratifying, there is ample opportunity to 
hone your ability on boards. But local boards can grow stale.  And almost 
every board maintains a list of phone-numbers to other boards, some in 
distant, tempting, exotic locales.   Who knows what they're up to, in 
Oregon or Alaska or Florida or California?  It's very easy to find out -- just  
order the  modem to call through its software -- nothing to this, just typing 
on a keyboard, the same thing you would do for most any computer game.   
The machine reacts swiftly and in a few seconds you are talking to a bunch 
of interesting people on another seaboard. 
<P>	And yet the <I>bills</I> for this trivial action can be staggering!  Just by 
going tippety-tap with your fingers, you may have saddled your parents 
with four hundred bucks in long-distance charges, and gotten chewed out 
but good. That hardly seems fair. 
<P>	How horrifying to have made friends in another state and to be 
deprived of their company -- and their software -  just because telephone 
companies demand absurd amounts of money!   How painful, to be 
restricted to boards in one's own <I>area code</I> --   what the heck is an "area 
code" anyway, and what makes it so special?   A few grumbles, 
complaints, and innocent questions of this sort will often elicit a 
sympathetic reply from another board user  --  someone with some stolen 
codes to hand.  You dither a while,  knowing this isn't quite right, then you 
make up your mind to try them anyhow -- <I>and they work!</I> Suddenly 
you're doing something even your parents can't do.  Six months ago you 
were just some kid -- now, you're the Crimson Flash of Area Code 512!   
You're bad -- you're nationwide! Maybe you'll stop at a few abused codes.  
Maybe you'll decide that boards aren't all that interesting after all, that it's 
wrong, not worth the risk  -- but maybe you won't. The next step is to pick 
up your own repeat-dialling program --  to learn to generate your own 
stolen codes. (This was dead easy five years ago, much harder to get away 
with nowadays, but not yet impossible.)   And these dialling programs are 
not complex or intimidating -- some are as small as twenty lines of 
software. Now, you too can share codes.   You can trade codes to learn 
other techniques.   If you're smart enough to catch on, and obsessive 
enough to want to bother,  and ruthless enough to start seriously bending 
rules, then you'll get better, fast.  You start to develop a rep.  You  move 
up to a heavier class of board -- a board with a bad attitude, the kind of 
board that naive dopes like your classmates and your former self have 
never even heard of!  You pick up the jargon of phreaking and hacking 
from the board.   You read a few of those anarchy philes -- and man, you 
never realized you could be a real <I>outlaw</I> without ever leaving your 
bedroom. 
<P>	You still play other computer games, but now you have a new and 
bigger game.   This one will bring you a different kind of status than 
destroying even eight zillion lousy space invaders. 
<P>	Hacking is perceived by hackers as a "game."  This is not an 
entirely unreasonable or sociopathic perception. You can win or lose at 
hacking, succeed or fail, but it never feels "real."  It's not simply that 
imaginative youngsters sometimes have a hard time telling "make-believe" 
from "real life."  Cyberspace is <I>not real!</I>  "Real" things are physical 
objects like trees and  shoes and cars.  Hacking takes place on a screen.   
Words aren't physical, numbers (even telephone numbers and credit card 
numbers) aren't physical.  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but data 
will never hurt me.  Computers <I>simulate</I> reality, like computer games 
that simulate tank battles or dogfights or spaceships.   Simulations are just 
makebelieve, and the stuff in computers is <I>not real.</I> 
<P>	Consider this:  if "hacking" is supposed to be so serious and real-
life and  dangerous, then how come <I>nine-year-old kids</I> have computers 
and modems?  You  wouldn't give a nine year old his own car, or his own 
rifle, or his own chainsaw -- those things are "real." 
<P>	People underground are perfectly aware that the "game" is frowned 
upon by the powers that be.   Word gets around about busts in the 
underground.   Publicizing busts  is one of the primary functions of pirate 
boards,  but they also promulgate an attitude about them, and their own 
idiosyncratic ideas of justice.   The users of underground boards won't 
complain if some guy is busted for crashing systems, spreading viruses, or 
stealing money by wirefraud.   They may shake their heads with a sneaky 
grin, but they won't openly defend these practices.   But when a kid is 
charged with some theoretical amount of theft: $233,846.14, for instance, 
because he sneaked into a computer and copied something, and kept it in 
his house on a floppy disk -- this is regarded as a sign of near insanity from 
prosecutors, a sign that they've drastically mistaken the immaterial game 
of computing for their real and boring everyday world of fatcat corporate 
money. 
<P>	It's as if big companies and their suck-up lawyers think that 
computing belongs to them, and they can retail  it with price stickers, as if 
it were boxes of laundry soap! But pricing "information"  is like trying to 
price air or price dreams.  Well, anybody on a pirate board knows that 
computing can be, and ought to be, <I>free.</I>  Pirate boards are little 
independent worlds in cyberspace, and they don't belong to anybody but 
the underground.   Underground boards aren't "brought to you by Procter 
&amp; Gamble." 
<P>	To log on to an underground board can mean to experience 
liberation, to enter a world where, for once, money isn't everything and 
adults don't have all the answers. 
<P>	Let's sample another vivid hacker manifesto.  Here are some 
excerpts from "The Conscience of a Hacker," by "The Mentor," from 
<I>Phrack</I> Volume One, Issue 7, Phile 3. 
<P>	"I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, 
this is cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I 
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me.(...) 
<P>	"And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing 
through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic 
pulse is sent out, a refuge from day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a 
board is found.   'This is it...  this is where I belong...' "I know everyone 
here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear 
from them again... I know you all...(...) "This is our world now....  the 
world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.  We make use 
of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if 
it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We 
explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you 
call us criminals.  We exist without skin color, without nationality, without 
religious bias... and you call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, you 
wage wars, you murder, cheat and lie to us and try to make us believe that 
it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. 
<P>	"Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is 
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.  
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive 
me for." 


<P>	There have been underground boards almost as long as there have 
been boards.  One of the first was 8BBS, which became a stronghold of 
the West Coast phonephreak elite.   After going on-line in March 1980, 
8BBS sponsored "Susan Thunder," and "Tuc,"  and, most  notoriously, 
"the Condor."  "The Condor"  bore the singular distinction of becoming 
the most vilified American phreak and hacker ever.   Angry underground 
associates, fed up with Condor's peevish behavior, turned him in to police, 
along with a heaping double-helping of  outrageous hacker legendry.  As a 
result, Condor was kept in solitary confinement for seven months,  for fear 
that he might start World War Three by triggering missile silos from the 
prison payphone.  (Having served his time, Condor is now walking around 
loose;  WWIII has thus far conspicuously failed to occur.) 
<P>	The sysop of 8BBS was an ardent free-speech enthusiast who 
simply felt that <I>any</I> attempt to restrict the expression of his users was 
unconstitutional and immoral.   Swarms of the technically curious entered 
8BBS and emerged as phreaks and hackers, until, in 1982, a friendly 8BBS 
alumnus passed the sysop a new modem which had been purchased by 
credit-card fraud.  Police took this opportunity to seize the entire board 
and remove what they considered an attractive nuisance. 
<P>	Plovernet was a powerful East Coast pirate board that operated in 
both New York and Florida.  Owned and operated by teenage hacker 
"Quasi Moto,"  Plovernet attracted five hundred eager users in 1983.  
"Emmanuel Goldstein" was one-time co-sysop of Plovernet, along with 
"Lex Luthor,"  founder of the "Legion of Doom" group. Plovernet  bore 
the signal honor of being the original home of the "Legion of Doom," 
about which the reader will be hearing a great deal, soon. 
<P>	"Pirate-80," or "P-80," run by a sysop known as "Scan- Man," got 
into the game very early in Charleston, and continued steadily for years.  
P-80 flourished so flagrantly that even its most hardened users became 
nervous, and some slanderously speculated that "Scan Man" must have ties 
to corporate security, a charge he vigorously denied. 
<P>	"414 Private" was the home board for the first <I>group</I> to attract 
conspicuous trouble, the teenage "414 Gang," whose intrusions into Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center and Los Alamos military computers were to be a 
nine-dayswonder in 1982. 
<P>	At about this time, the first software piracy boards began to open 
up, trading cracked games for the Atari 800 and the Commodore C64.   
Naturally these boards were heavily frequented by teenagers.  And with the 
1983 release of the hacker-thriller movie <I>War Games,</I> the scene 
exploded.   It seemed that every kid in America had demanded and  gotten 
a modem for Christmas.  Most of these dabbler wannabes put their 
modems in the attic after a few weeks, and most of the remainder minded 
their P's and Q's and stayed well out of hot water.  But some stubborn and 
talented diehards had this hacker kid in <I>War Games</I> figured for a 
happening dude.   They simply  could not rest until they had contacted the 
underground -or, failing that, created their own. 
<P>	In the mid-80s, underground boards sprang up like digital fungi.  
ShadowSpawn Elite.  Sherwood Forest I, II, and III. Digital Logic Data 
Service in Florida, sysoped by no less a man than "Digital Logic" himself; 
Lex Luthor of the Legion of Doom was prominent on this board, since it 
was in his area code.  Lex's own board,  "Legion of Doom," started in 
1984.  The Neon Knights ran a network of Applehacker boards: Neon 
Knights North, South, East and West.   Free World II was run by "Major 
Havoc."  Lunatic Labs is still in operation as of this writing.   Dr. Ripco in 
Chicago, an anything-goes anarchist board with an extensive and raucous 
history, was seized by Secret Service agents in 1990 on Sundevil day, but 
up again almost immediately, with new machines and scarcely diminished  
vigor. 
<P>	The St. Louis scene was not to rank with major centers of 
American hacking such as New York and L.A.  But St. Louis did rejoice in 
possession of "Knight Lightning" and "Taran King,"  two of the foremost 
<I>journalists</I> native to the underground.   Missouri boards like Metal 
Shop, Metal Shop Private, Metal Shop Brewery, may not have been the 
heaviest boards around in terms of illicit expertise.  But they became 
boards where hackers could exchange social gossip and try to figure out 
what the heck was going on nationally -- and internationally.   Gossip from 
Metal Shop was put into the form of news files, then assembled into a 
general electronic publication, <I>Phrack,</I> a portmanteau title coined from 
"phreak" and "hack."  The <I>Phrack</I> editors were as obsessively curious 
about other hackers as hackers were about machines. 
<P>	<I>Phrack,</I> being free of charge and lively reading, began to 
circulate throughout the underground.   As Taran King and Knight 
Lightning left high school for college, <I>Phrack</I> began to appear on 
mainframe machines linked to BITNET, and, through BITNET to the 
"Internet,"  that loose but extremely potent not-for-profit network where 
academic, governmental and corporate machines trade data through the 
UNIX TCP/IP protocol.   (The "Internet Worm"  of  November 2-3,1988, 
created by Cornell grad student Robert Morris,  was to be the largest and 
bestpublicized computer-intrusion scandal to date.  Morris claimed that his 
ingenious "worm" program was meant to harmlessly explore the Internet, 
but due to bad programming, the Worm replicated out of control and  
crashed some six thousand Internet computers.   Smallerscale and less 
ambitious Internet hacking was a standard for the underground elite.) Most 
any underground board not hopelessly lame and out-of-it would feature a 
complete run of <I>Phrack</I> -and, possibly, the lesser-known standards of 
the underground:  the <I>Legion of Doom Technical Journal,</I> the obscene 
and raucous <I>Cult of the Dead Cow</I>  files, <I>P/HUN</I>  magazine,  
<I>Pirate,</I>  the <I>Syndicate Reports,</I> and perhaps the highly anarcho-
political <I>Activist Times Incorporated.</I> 
<P>	Possession of <I>Phrack</I>  on one's board was prima  facie evidence 
of a bad attitude.   <I>Phrack</I> was seemingly everywhere, aiding, abetting, 
and spreading the underground ethos.  And this did not escape the 
attention of corporate security or the police. 

<P>	We now come to the touchy subject of police and boards.  Police, 
do, in fact, own boards.   In 1989, there were police-sponsored boards in 
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, 
and Virginia: boards such as "Crime Bytes,"  "Crimestoppers,"  "All  
Points" and "Bullet-N-Board."   Police officers, as private computer 
enthusiasts, ran their own boards in Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Florida, Missouri, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.   Police boards have often proved helpful in 
community relations.  Sometimes crimes are reported on police boards. 
<P>	Sometimes crimes are <I>committed</I>  on police boards.  This has 
sometimes happened by accident, as naive hackers blunder onto police 
boards and blithely  begin offering telephone codes.  Far more often, 
however, it occurs through the now almost-traditional use of "sting 
boards."  The first police sting-boards were established in 1985:  
"Underground Tunnel" in Austin, Texas, whose sysop Sgt. Robert Ansley 
called himself "Pluto" -- "The Phone Company" in Phoenix, Arizona, run 
by Ken MacLeod of the Maricopa County Sheriff's office -- and Sgt. Dan 
Pasquale's board in Fremont, California.   Sysops posed as hackers, and 
swiftly garnered coteries of ardent users, who posted codes and loaded 
pirate software with abandon, and came to a sticky end. 
<P>	Sting boards, like other boards, are cheap to operate, very cheap by 
the standards of undercover police operations.  Once accepted by the local 
underground, sysops will likely be invited into other pirate boards, where 
they can compile more dossiers.  And when the sting is announced and the 
worst offenders arrested, the publicity is generally  gratifying.  The 
resultant paranoia in the underground -- perhaps more justly described as a 
"deterrence effect" -- tends to quell local lawbreaking for quite a while. 
<P>	Obviously police do not have to beat the underbrush for hackers.  
On the contrary, they can go trolling for them. Those caught can be grilled.  
Some become useful informants.  They can lead the way to pirate boards 
all across the country. 
<P>	And boards all across the country showed the sticky fingerprints of 
<I>Phrack,</I> and of that loudest and most flagrant of all underground groups, 
the "Legion of Doom." 
<P>	The term "Legion of Doom" came from comic books. The Legion 
of Doom, a conspiracy of costumed supervillains headed by the chrome-
domed criminal ultramastermind Lex Luthor, gave Superman a lot of four-
color graphic trouble for a number of decades.   Of course, Superman, that 
exemplar of Truth, Justice, and the American Way, always won in the long 
run.   This didn't matter to the hacker Doomsters -- "Legion of Doom" was  
not some thunderous and evil Satanic reference, it was not meant to be 
taken seriously.  "Legion of Doom" came from funny-books and was 
supposed to be funny. "Legion of Doom" did have a good mouthfilling 
ring to it, though.  It sounded really cool.  Other groups, such as the 
"Farmers of Doom," closely allied to LoD, recognized this grandiloquent 
quality, and made fun of it.  There was even a hacker group called "Justice 
League of America," named after Superman's club of true-blue 
crimefighting superheros. 
<P>	But they didn't last; the Legion did. The original Legion of Doom, 
hanging out on Quasi Moto's Plovernet board, were phone phreaks.   They 
weren't much into computers.   "Lex Luthor" himself (who was under 
eighteen when he formed the Legion)  was a COSMOS expert, COSMOS 
being the "Central System for Mainframe Operations," a telco internal 
computer network.   Lex would eventually become quite a dab hand at 
breaking into IBM mainframes, but although everyone liked Lex and 
admired his attitude, he was not considered a truly accomplished computer 
intruder.  Nor was he the "mastermind" of the Legion of Doom --  LoD 
were never big on formal leadership.  As a regular on Plovernet and sysop 
of his "Legion of Doom BBS,"  Lex was the Legion's cheerleader and 
recruiting officer. 
<P>	Legion of Doom began on the ruins of an earlier phreak group, The 
Knights of Shadow.  Later, LoD was to subsume the personnel of the 
hacker group "Tribunal of Knowledge."  People came and went constantly 
in LoD; groups split up or formed offshoots. 
<P>	Early on, the LoD phreaks befriended a few computer-intrusion 
enthusiasts, who became the associated "Legion of Hackers."  Then the 
two groups conflated into the "Legion of Doom/Hackers,"  or LoD/H. 
When the original "hacker" wing, Messrs. "CompuPhreak" and "Phucked 
Agent 04," found other matters to occupy their time, the extra "/H" slowly 
atrophied out of the name;  but by this time the phreak wing, Messrs.  Lex 
Luthor, "Blue Archer," "Gary Seven," "Kerrang Khan," "Master of 
Impact," "Silver Spy," "The Marauder," and "The Videosmith," had picked 
up a plethora of intrusion expertise and had become a force to be reckoned 
with. 
<P>	LoD members seemed to have an instinctive understanding that the 
way to real power in the underground lay through covert publicity.   LoD 
were  flagrant.  Not only was it one of the earliest groups, but the members 
took pains to widely distribute their illicit knowledge.   Some LoD 
members, like "The Mentor," were close to evangelical about it.   <I>Legion 
of Doom Technical Journal</I>  began to show up on boards throughout the 
underground. 
<P>	<I>LoD Technical Journal</I> was named in cruel parody of the ancient 
and honored <I>AT&amp;T Technical Journal.</I> The material in these two 
publications was quite similar -much of it, adopted from public journals 
and discussions in the telco community.  And yet, the predatory attitude of 
LoD made even its most innocuous data seem deeply sinister; an outrage; 
a clear and present danger. 
<P>	To see why this should be, let's consider the following (invented) 
paragraphs, as a kind of thought experiment. 
<P>	(A)  "W. Fred Brown, AT&amp;T Vice President for Advanced 
Technical Development, testified May 8  at a Washington hearing of the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), 
regarding Bellcore's GARDEN project.  GARDEN (Generalized 
Automatic Remote Distributed Electronic Network)  is a telephone-switch 
programming tool that makes it possible to develop new telecom services, 
including hold-on-hold and customized message transfers,  from any 
keypad terminal, within seconds.   The GARDEN prototype combines 
centrex lines with a minicomputer using UNIX operating system 
software." 
<P>	(B)  "Crimson Flash 512 of the Centrex Mobsters reports:  D00dz, 
you wouldn't believe this GARDEN  bullshit Bellcore's just come up with!   
Now you don't even need a lousy Commodore to reprogram a switch -- 
just log on to GARDEN as a technician, and you can reprogram switches 
right off the keypad in any public phone booth! You can give yourself 
hold-on-hold and customized message transfers, and best of all, the thing 
is run off (notoriously insecure)  centrex lines using -- get this -standard 
UNIX software!  Ha ha ha ha!" 
<P>	Message (A), couched in typical technobureaucratese, appears 
tedious and almost unreadable. (A) scarcely seems threatening or 
menacing.   Message (B), on the other hand, is a dreadful thing, prima 
facie  evidence of a dire conspiracy, definitely not the kind of thing you 
want your teenager reading. The <I>information,</I> however, is identical.  It is 
<I>public</I> information, presented before the federal government in an open 
hearing.  It is not "secret."  It is not "proprietary." It is not even 
"confidential."  On the contrary, the development of advanced software 
systems is a matter of great public pride to Bellcore. However, when 
Bellcore publicly announces a project of this kind, it expects a certain 
attitude from the public -- something along the lines of  <I>gosh wow, you 
guys are great, keep that up, whatever it is</I>  --  certainly not cruel 
mimickry, one-upmanship and outrageous speculations about possible 
security holes. 
<P>	Now put yourself in the place of a policeman confronted by an 
outraged parent, or telco official, with a copy of Version (B).  This well-
meaning citizen, to his horror, has discovered a local bulletin-board 
carrying  outrageous stuff like (B), which his son is examining with a deep 
and unhealthy interest.   If (B) were printed in a book or magazine, you, as 
an American law enforcement officer, would know that it would take a 
hell of a lot of trouble to do anything about it;  but it doesn't take technical 
genius to recognize that if there's a computer in your area harboring stuff 
like (B), there's going to be trouble. 
<P>	In fact, if you ask around, any computer-literate cop will tell you 
straight out that boards with stuff like (B) are the <I>source</I> of trouble.  
And the <I>worst</I> source of trouble on boards are the ringleaders inventing 
and spreading stuff like (B).  If it weren't for these jokers, there wouldn't 
<I>be</I> any trouble. 
<P>	And Legion of Doom were on boards like nobody else.  Plovernet.  
The Legion of Doom Board.  The Farmers of Doom Board.  Metal Shop.  
OSUNY.  Blottoland. Private Sector.  Atlantis.  Digital Logic.  Hell 
Phrozen Over. 
<P>	LoD members also ran their own boards.  "Silver Spy" started his 
own board, "Catch-22,"  considered one of the heaviest around.   So did 
"Mentor," with his "Phoenix Project."   When they didn't run boards 
themselves, they showed up on other people's boards, to brag, boast, and 
strut.  And where they themselves didn't go, their philes went, carrying evil 
knowledge and an even more evil attitude. As early as 1986, the police 
were under the vague impression that <I>everyone</I> in the underground was 
Legion of Doom.   LoD was never that large -considerably smaller than 
either "Metal  Communications" or "The Administration," for instance --
but LoD got tremendous press.  Especially in <I>Phrack,</I> which at times 
read like an LoD fan magazine; and <I>Phrack</I> was everywhere, especially 
in the offices of telco security.   You couldn't <I>get</I> busted as a phone 
phreak, a hacker, or even a lousy codes kid or warez dood, without the 
cops asking if you were LoD. 
<P>	This was a difficult charge to deny, as LoD never distributed 
membership badges or laminated ID cards.  If they had, they would likely 
have died out quickly, for turnover in their membership was considerable.  
LoD was less a high-tech street-gang than an ongoing state-ofmind.  LoD 
was the Gang That Refused to Die.   By 1990, LoD had <I>ruled</I> for ten 
years, and it seemed <I>weird</I> to police that they were continually busting 
people who were only sixteen years old.   All these teenage small-timers 
were pleading the tiresome hacker litany  of "just curious, no criminal 
intent."  Somewhere at the center of this conspiracy there had to be some 
serious adult masterminds, not this seemingly endless supply of myopic 
suburban white kids with high SATs and funny haircuts. 
<P>	There was no question that most any American hacker arrested 
would "know" LoD.  They knew the handles of contributors to <I>LoD Tech 
Journal,</I>  and were likely to have learned their craft through LoD boards 
and LoD activism.  But they'd never met anyone from LoD. Even some of 
the rotating cadre who were actually and formally "in LoD" knew one 
another only by board-mail and pseudonyms.   This was a highly 
unconventional profile for a criminal conspiracy.  Computer networking, 
and the rapid evolution of the digital underground,  made the situation very 
diffuse and confusing. 
<P>	Furthermore, a big reputation in the digital underground did not 
coincide with one's willingness to commit "crimes."   Instead, reputation 
was based on cleverness and technical mastery.  As a result, it often 
seemed that the <I>heavier</I> the hackers were, the <I>less</I> likely they were to 
have committed any kind of common, easily prosecutable crime.   There 
were some hackers who could really steal.  And there were hackers who 
could really hack.  But the two groups didn't seem to overlap much, if at 
all.   For instance, most people in the underground looked up to 
"Emmanuel Goldstein" of <I>2600</I> as a hacker demigod.  But Goldstein's 
publishing activities were entirely legal -- Goldstein just printed dodgy 
stuff and talked about politics, he didn't even hack. When you came right 
down to it, Goldstein spent half his time complaining that computer 
security <I>wasn't strong enough</I> and ought to be drastically improved 
across the board! 
<P>	Truly heavy-duty hackers, those with serious technical skills who 
had earned the respect of the underground,  never stole money or abused 
credit cards. Sometimes they might abuse phone-codes -- but often, they 
seemed to get all the free phone-time they wanted without leaving a trace 
of any kind. 
<P>	The best hackers, the most powerful and technically accomplished, 
were not professional fraudsters.   They raided computers habitually, but 
wouldn't alter anything, or damage anything.  They didn't even steal 
computer equipment -- most had day-jobs messing with hardware, and 
could get all the cheap secondhand equipment they wanted.   The hottest 
hackers, unlike the teenage wannabes,  weren't snobs about fancy or 
expensive hardware.  Their machines tended to be raw second-hand  
digital hot-rods full of custom add-ons that they'd cobbled together out of 
chickenwire, memory chips and spit.  Some were adults, computer 
software writers and consultants by trade, and making quite good livings at 
it.  Some of them <I>actually worked for the phone company</I> --  and for 
those, the "hackers" actually found under the skirts of Ma Bell, there 
would be little mercy in 1990. 

<P>	It has long been an article of faith in the underground that the 
"best" hackers never get caught. They're far too smart, supposedly.  They 
never get caught because they never boast, brag, or strut.   These demigods 
may read underground boards (with a condescending smile), but they 
never say anything there.   The "best" hackers, according to legend, are 
adult computer professionals, such as mainframe system administrators, 
who already know the ins and outs of their particular  brand of security.   
Even the "best" hacker can't break in to just any computer at random: the 
knowledge of security holes is too specialized, varying widely with 
different software and hardware.  But if people are employed to run, say, a 
UNIX mainframe or a VAX/VMS machine, then they tend to learn 
security from the inside out.  Armed with this knowledge, they can look 
into most anybody else's UNIX or VMS without much trouble or risk, if 
they want to.   And, according to hacker legend, of course they  want to, so 
of course they do.   They just don't make a big deal of what they've done.  
So nobody ever finds out. 
<P>	It is also an article of faith in the underground that professional 
telco people "phreak" like crazed weasels. <I>Of course</I> they spy on 
Madonna's phone calls -- I mean, <I>wouldn't you?</I>  Of course they give 
themselves free longdistance -- why the hell should <I>they</I> pay, they're 
running the whole shebang! It has, as a third matter, long been an article of 
faith that any hacker caught can escape serious punishment if he confesses 
<I>how he did it.</I>  Hackers seem to believe that governmental agencies and 
large corporations are blundering about in cyberspace like eyeless jellyfish 
or cave salamanders.  They feel that these large but pathetically stupid 
organizations will proffer up genuine gratitude, and perhaps even a 
security post and a big  salary, to the hot-shot intruder who will deign to 
reveal to them the supreme genius of his modus operandi. In the case of 
longtime LoD member "Control-C," this actually happened, more or less.   
Control-C had led Michigan Bell a merry chase, and when captured in 
1987, he turned out to be a bright and apparently physically harmless 
young fanatic, fascinated by phones.   There was no chance in hell that 
Control-C would actually repay the enormous and largely theoretical sums 
in long-distance service that he had accumulated from Michigan Bell.   He 
could always be indicted for fraud or computer-intrusion, but there seemed 
little real point in this -- he hadn't physically damaged any computer.  He'd 
just plead guilty, and he'd likely get the usual slap-on-the-wrist, and in the 
meantime it would be a big hassle for Michigan Bell just  to bring up the 
case.  But if kept on the payroll, he might at least keep his fellow hackers 
at bay. 
<P>	There were uses for him.  For instance, a contrite Control-C was 
featured on Michigan Bell internal posters, sternly warning employees to 
shred their trash.   He'd always gotten most of his best inside info from 
"trashing" - raiding telco dumpsters, for useful data indiscreetly thrown 
away.   He signed these posters, too.  Control-C had become something 
like a Michigan Bell mascot.  And in fact, Control-C <I>did</I> keep other 
hackers at bay.  Little hackers were quite scared of Control-C and his 
heavy-duty Legion of Doom friends.   And big hackers <I>were</I> his friends 
and didn't want to screw up his cushy situation.


<P>	No matter what one might say of LoD, they did stick together.   
When "Wasp," an apparently genuinely malicious New York hacker, 
began crashing Bellcore machines,  Control-C received swift volunteer 
help from "the Mentor" and the Georgia LoD wing  made up of "The  
Prophet," "Urvile," and "Leftist."   Using Mentor's Phoenix Project board 
to coordinate, the Doomsters helped telco security to trap Wasp, by luring 
him into a machine with a tap and line-trace installed.  Wasp lost.  LoD 
won!  And my, did they brag. 

<P>	Urvile, Prophet and Leftist were well-qualified for this activity, 
probably more so even than the quite accomplished Control-C.  The 
Georgia boys knew all about phone switching-stations.  Though relative 
johnny-comelatelies in the Legion of Doom, they were considered some of 
LoD's heaviest guys, into the hairiest systems around. They had the good 
fortune to live in or near Atlanta, home of the sleepy and apparently 
tolerant BellSouth RBOC. 
<P>	As RBOC security went, BellSouth were "cake."   US West (of 
Arizona, the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest) were tough and 
aggressive, probably the heaviest RBOC around.  Pacific Bell, California's 
PacBell, were sleek, high- tech, and longtime veterans of the LA phone-
phreak wars. NYNEX had the misfortune to run the New York City area, 
and were warily prepared for most anything.   Even Michigan Bell, a 
division of the Ameritech RBOC, at least had the elementary sense to hire 
their own hacker as a useful scarecrow.  But BellSouth, even though their 
corporate P.R.  proclaimed them to have "Everything You Expect From a 
Leader," were pathetic. 
<P>	When rumor about LoD's mastery of Georgia's switching network 
got around to BellSouth through Bellcore and telco security scuttlebutt, 
they at first refused to believe it.   If you paid serious attention to every 
rumor out and about these hacker kids, you would hear all kinds of wacko 
saucer-nut nonsense:  that the National Security Agency monitored all 
American phone calls, that the CIA and DEA tracked traffic on bulletin-
boards with wordanalysis programs, that the Condor could start World 
War III from a payphone. 
<P>	If there were hackers into BellSouth switchingstations, then how 
come nothing had happened?  Nothing had been hurt.  BellSouth's 
machines weren't crashing. BellSouth wasn't suffering especially badly 
from fraud. BellSouth's customers weren't complaining.  BellSouth  was 
headquartered in Atlanta, ambitious metropolis of the new high-tech 
Sunbelt; and BellSouth was upgrading its network by leaps and bounds, 
digitizing the works left right and center.   They could hardly be 
considered sluggish or naive.  BellSouth's technical expertise was second 
to none, thank you kindly. 
<P>	But then came the Florida business. 
<P>	On June 13, 1989, callers to the Palm Beach County Probation 
Department, in Delray Beach, Florida,  found themselves involved in a 
remarkable discussion with a phone-sex worker named "Tina" in New 
York State. Somehow, <I>any</I> call to this probation office near Miami was 
instantly and magically transported across state lines, at no extra charge to 
the user, to a pornographic phonesex hotline hundreds of miles away! 
<P>	This practical joke may seem utterly hilarious at first hearing, and 
indeed there was a good deal of chuckling about it in phone phreak circles, 
including the Autumn  1989 issue of <I>2600.</I>  But for Southern Bell  (the 
division of the BellSouth RBOC supplying local service for Florida, 
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina),  this was a smoking gun.  
For the first time ever,  a computer intruder had broken into a BellSouth 
central office switching station and re-programmed it! 
<P>	Or so BellSouth thought in June 1989.  Actually, LoD members 
had been frolicking harmlessly in BellSouth switches since September 
1987.  The stunt of June 13 -call-forwarding a number through 
manipulation of a switching station -- was child's play for hackers as 
accomplished as the Georgia wing of LoD.  Switching calls interstate 
sounded like a big deal, but it took only four lines of code to accomplish 
this.    An easy, yet more discreet, stunt, would be to call-forward another 
number to your own house.  If you were careful and considerate, and 
changed the software back later, then not a soul would know.

<P>	Except you.  And whoever you had bragged to about it. 
<P>	As for BellSouth, what they didn't know wouldn't hurt them. 
Except now somebody had blown the whole thing wide open, and 
BellSouth knew. A now alerted and considerably paranoid BellSouth 
began searching switches right and left for signs of impropriety, in that hot 
summer of 1989.  No fewer than forty-two BellSouth employees were put 
on 12-hour shifts, twenty-four hours a day, for two solid months, poring 
over records and monitoring computers for any sign of phony access.  
These forty-two overworked experts were known as BellSouth's  
"Intrusion Task Force." 


<P>	What the investigators found astounded them. Proprietary telco 
databases had been manipulated: phone numbers had been created out of 
thin air, with no users' names and no addresses.  And perhaps worst of all, 
no charges and no records of use.   The new digital ReMOB

<P>	(Remote Observation)  diagnostic feature had been extensively 
tampered with -- hackers had learned to reprogram ReMOB software, so 
that they could listen in on any switch-routed call at their leisure!   They 
were using telco property to <I>spy!</I> 

<P>	The electrifying news went out throughout law enforcement in 
1989.  It had never really occurred to anyone at BellSouth that their prized 
and brand-new digital switching-stations could be <I>re-programmed.</I> 
People seemed utterly amazed that anyone could have the nerve.   Of 
course these switching stations were "computers," and everybody knew 
hackers liked to "break into computers:"   but telephone people's 
computers were <I>different</I> from normal people's computers.



<P>	The exact reason <I>why</I> these computers were "different" was 
rather ill-defined.  It certainly wasn't the extent of their security.  The 
security on these BellSouth computers was lousy;  the AIMSX computers, 
for instance, didn't even have passwords.   But there was no question that 
BellSouth strongly <I>felt</I> that their computers were very different indeed.  
And if there were some criminals out there who had not gotten that 
message, BellSouth was determined to see that message taught. 
<P>	After all, a 5ESS switching station was no mere bookkeeping 
system for some local chain of florists. Public service depended on these 
stations.   Public <I>safety</I> depended on these stations. 
<P>	And hackers, lurking in there call-forwarding or ReMobbing,  
could spy on anybody in the local area! They could spy on telco officials!  
They could spy on police stations!  They could spy on local offices of the 
Secret Service.... 
<P>	In 1989, electronic cops and hacker-trackers began using 
scrambler-phones and secured lines.  It only made sense.  There was no 
telling who was into those systems. Whoever they were, they sounded 
scary.   This was some new level of antisocial daring.  Could be West 
German hackers, in the pay of the KGB.   That too had seemed a weird and 
farfetched notion, until Clifford Stoll had poked and prodded a sluggish 
Washington law-enforcement bureaucracy into investigating a computer 
intrusion that turned out to be exactly that -- <I>hackers, in the pay of the 
KGB!</I>    Stoll, the  systems manager for an Internet lab in Berkeley 
California, had ended up on the front page of the <I>New York  Times,</I>  
proclaimed a national  hero in the first true story of international computer 
espionage. Stoll's counterspy efforts, which he related in a bestselling 
book, <I>The Cuckoo's Egg,</I>  in 1989, had established the credibility of 
'hacking' as a possible threat to national security.  The United States Secret 
Service doesn't mess around when it suspects a possible action by a 
foreign intelligence apparat. The Secret Service scrambler-phones and 
secured lines put a tremendous kink in law enforcement's ability to operate 
freely; to get the word out, cooperate, prevent misunderstandings.   
Nevertheless, 1989 scarcely seemed the time for half-measures.  If the 
police and Secret Service themselves were not operationally secure, then 
how could they reasonably demand measures of security from private 
enterprise?  At least, the inconvenience made people aware of the 
seriousness  of the threat. 
<P>	If there was a final spur needed to get the police off the dime, it 
came in the realization that the emergency 911 system was vulnerable.   
The 911 system has its own specialized software, but it is run on the same 
digital switching systems as the rest of the telephone network. 911 is not 
physically different from normal telephony.  But it is certainly culturally  
different, because this is the area of telephonic cyberspace reserved for the 
police and emergency services. Your average policeman may not know 
much about hackers or phone-phreaks.  Computer people are weird; even 
computer <I>cops</I>  are rather weird; the stuff they do is hard to figure out.   
But a threat to the 911 system is anything but an abstract threat.  If the 911 
system goes, people can die. 
<P>	Imagine being in a car-wreck, staggering to a phonebooth, 
punching 911 and hearing "Tina" pick up the phone-sex line somewhere in 
New York!   The situation's no longer comical, somehow. 

<P>	And was it possible?  No question.  Hackers had attacked 911 
systems before.  Phreaks can max-out 911 systems just by siccing a bunch 
of computer-modems on them in tandem, dialling them over and over until 
they clog.  That's very crude and low-tech, but it's still a serious business. 
<P>	The time had come for action.  It was time to take  stern measures 
with the underground.  It was time to start picking up the dropped threads, 
the loose edges, the bits of braggadocio here and there; it was time to get 
on the stick and start putting serious casework together.  Hackers weren't 
"invisible."  They <I>thought</I>  they were invisible; but the truth was, they 
had just been tolerated too long. 
<P>	Under sustained police attention in the summer of '89, the digital 
underground began to unravel as never before. 
<P>	The first big break in the case came very early on: July 1989, the 
following month.  The perpetrator of the "Tina" switch was caught, and 
confessed.  His name was "Fry Guy," a 16-year-old in Indiana.  Fry Guy 
had been a very wicked young man. 
<P>	Fry Guy had earned his handle from a stunt involving French fries.  
Fry Guy had filched the log-in of a local MacDonald's manager and had 
logged-on to the MacDonald's mainframe on the Sprint Telenet system. 
Posing as the manager, Fry Guy had altered MacDonald's records, and 
given some teenage hamburger-flipping friends of his, generous raises.  He 
had not been caught. 
<P>	Emboldened by success, Fry Guy moved on to creditcard abuse.  
Fry Guy was quite an accomplished talker; with a gift for "social 
engineering."   If you can do "social engineering"  -- fast-talk, fake-outs, 
impersonation, conning, scamming -- then card abuse comes easy.  
(Getting away with it in the long run is another question). Fry Guy had run 
across "Urvile" of the Legion of Doom on the ALTOS Chat board in 
Bonn, Germany. ALTOS Chat was a sophisticated board, accessible 
through globe-spanning computer networks like BITnet, Tymnet, and 
Telenet.    ALTOS was much frequented by members of Germany's  Chaos 
Computer Club.  Two Chaos hackers who hung out on ALTOS, "Jaeger" 
and  "Pengo," had been the central villains of Clifford Stoll's CUCKOO'S 
EGG case:  consorting in East Berlin with a spymaster from the KGB, and 
breaking into American computers for hire, through the Internet. When 
LoD members learned the story of Jaeger's depredations from Stoll's book, 
they were rather less than impressed, technically speaking.  On LoD's own 
favorite board of the moment, "Black Ice," LoD members bragged that 
they themselves could have done all the Chaos breakins in a week flat!  
Nevertheless,  LoD were grudgingly impressed by the Chaos rep, the sheer 
hairy-eyed daring of hash-smoking anarchist hackers who had rubbed 
shoulders with the fearsome big-boys of international Communist 
espionage.  LoD members sometimes traded bits of knowledge with 
friendly German hackers on ALTOS -- phone numbers for vulnerable 
VAX/VMS computers in Georgia, for instance.  Dutch and British phone 
phreaks, and the Australian clique of "Phoenix," "Nom," and "Electron," 
were ALTOS regulars, too.  In underground circles, to hang out on 
ALTOS was considered the sign of an elite dude, a sophisticated hacker of 
the international digital jet-set. 
<P>	Fry Guy quickly learned how to raid information from credit-card 
consumer-reporting agencies.  He had over a hundred stolen credit-card 
numbers in his notebooks, and upwards of a thousand swiped long-
distance access codes. He knew how to get onto Altos, and how to talk the 
talk of the underground convincingly.  He now wheedled knowledge of 
switching-station tricks from Urvile on the ALTOS system. 
<P>	Combining these two forms of knowledge enabled Fry Guy to 
bootstrap his way up to a new form of wirefraud.  First, he'd snitched 
credit card numbers from credit-company computers.  The data he copied 
included names, addresses and phone numbers of the random card-holders. 
<P>	Then Fry Guy, impersonating a card-holder, called up Western 
Union and asked for a cash advance on "his" credit card.  Western Union, 
as a security guarantee, would call the customer back, at home, to verify 
the transaction. 
<P>	But, just as he had switched the Florida probation office to "Tina" 
in New York,  Fry Guy switched the cardholder's number to a local pay-
phone.  There he would  lurk in wait, muddying his trail by routing and re-
routing the call, through switches as far away as Canada.   When the call 
came through, he would boldly "social-engineer," or con, the Western 
Union people, pretending to be the legitimate card-holder.  Since he'd 
answered the proper phone number, the deception was not very hard. 
Western Union's money was then shipped to a confederate of Fry Guy's in 
his home town in Indiana. 
<P>	Fry Guy and his cohort, using LoD techniques, stole six thousand 
dollars from Western Union between December 1988 and July 1989.  
They also dabbled in  ordering delivery of stolen goods through card-
fraud.  Fry Guy was intoxicated with success.  The sixteen-year-old 
fantasized wildly to hacker rivals, boasting that he'd used rip-off money to 
hire  himself a big limousine, and had driven out-of-state with a groupie 
from his favorite heavymetal band, Motley Crue. Armed with knowledge, 
power, and a gratifying stream of free money, Fry Guy now took it upon 
himself to call local representatives of Indiana Bell security, to brag, boast, 
strut, and utter tormenting warnings that his powerful friends in the 
notorious Legion of Doom could crash the national telephone network.  
Fry Guy even named a date for the scheme:  the Fourth of July, a national 
holiday. 
<P>	This egregious example of the begging-for-arrest  syndrome was 
shortly followed by Fry Guy's arrest.  After the Indiana telephone company 
figured out who he was, the Secret Service had DNRs -- Dialed Number 
Recorders -- installed on his home phone lines.  These devices are not 
taps, and can't record the substance of phone calls, but they do record the 
phone numbers of all  calls going in and out.   Tracing these numbers 
showed Fry Guy's long-distance code fraud, his extensive ties to pirate 
bulletin boards, and numerous personal calls to his LoD friends in Atlanta.   
By July 11, 1989, Prophet, Urvile and Leftist also had Secret Service DNR 
"pen registers" installed on their own lines. 
<P>	The Secret Service showed up in force at Fry Guy's house on July 
22, 1989, to the horror of his unsuspecting parents.  The raiders were led 
by a special agent from the Secret Service's Indianapolis office.   However, 
the raiders were accompanied and advised by Timothy M. Foley of the 
Secret Service's Chicago office (a gentleman about whom we will soon be 
hearing a great deal). 
<P>	Following federal computer-crime techniques that had been 
standard since the early 1980s, the Secret Service searched the house 
thoroughly, and seized all of Fry Guy's electronic equipment and 
notebooks.   All Fry Guy's equipment went out the door in the custody of 
the  Secret Service, which put a swift end to his depredations. 
<P>	The USSS interrogated Fry Guy at length.  His case was put in the 
charge of Deborah Daniels, the federal US  Attorney for the Southern 
District of Indiana.  Fry Guy was charged with eleven counts of computer 
fraud, unauthorized computer access, and wire fraud.   The evidence was 
thorough and irrefutable.  For his part, Fry Guy blamed his corruption on 
the Legion of Doom and offered to testify against them. 
<P>	Fry Guy insisted that the Legion intended to crash the phone 
system on a national holiday.   And when AT&amp;T crashed on Martin Luther 
King Day, 1990, this lent a credence to his claim that genuinely alarmed 
telco security and the Secret Service. Fry Guy eventually pled guilty on 
May 31, 1990.  On September 14, he was sentenced to forty-four months' 
probation and  four hundred hours' community service. He could have had 
it much worse; but it made sense to prosecutors to take it easy on this 
teenage minor, while zeroing in on the notorious kingpins of the Legion of 
Doom. But the case against LoD had nagging flaws. Despite the best effort 
of investigators, it was impossible to prove that the Legion had crashed the 
phone system on January 15, because they, in fact, hadn't done so.  The 
investigations of 1989 did show that certain members of the Legion of 
Doom had achieved unprecedented power over the telco switching 
stations, and that they were in active conspiracy to obtain more power yet.  
Investigators were privately convinced that the Legion of Doom intended 
to do awful things with this knowledge, but mere evil intent was not 
enough to put them in jail. 



<P>	And although the Atlanta Three -- Prophet, Leftist, and especially 
Urvile -- had taught Fry Guy plenty, they were not themselves credit-card 
fraudsters.  The only  thing they'd "stolen" was long-distance service -- and 
since they'd done much of that through phone-switch manipulation, there 
was no easy way to judge how much they'd "stolen," or whether this 
practice was even "theft" of any easily recognizable kind. 


<P>	Fry Guy's theft of long-distance codes had cost the phone 
companies plenty.  The theft of long-distance service may be a fairly 
theoretical "loss,"  but it costs genuine money and genuine time to delete 
all those stolen codes, and to re-issue new codes to the innocent owners of 
those corrupted codes.  The owners of the codes themselves are 
victimized, and lose time and money and peace of mind in the hassle.   
And then there were the credit-card victims to deal with, too, and Western 
Union. When it came to rip-off, Fry Guy was far more of a thief than LoD.  
It was only when it came to actual computer expertise that Fry Guy was 
small potatoes. 
<P>	The Atlanta Legion thought most "rules" of cyberspace were for 
rodents and losers, but they <I>did</I> have rules.  <I>They never crashed 
anything, and they never took money.</I>   These were rough rules-of-thumb, 
and rather dubious principles when it comes to the ethical subtleties of 
cyberspace, but they enabled the Atlanta  Three to operate with a relatively 
clear conscience (though never with peace of mind). 
<P>	If you didn't hack for money, if you weren't robbing people of 
actual funds -- money in the bank, that is -then nobody <I>really</I> got hurt, in 
LoD's opinion.  "Theft of service" was a bogus issue, and "intellectual 
property" was a bad joke.   But LoD had only elitist contempt for rip-off 
artists, "leechers," thieves.   They considered themselves clean.

<P>	In their opinion, if you didn't smash-up or crash any systems  -- 
(well, not on purpose, anyhow -- accidents can happen, just ask Robert 
Morris)  then it was very unfair to call you a "vandal" or a "cracker."  
When you were hanging out on-line with your "pals" in telco security, you 
could face them down from the higher plane of hacker morality.  And you 
could mock the police from the supercilious heights of your hacker's quest 
for pure knowledge. 

<P>	But from the point of view of law enforcement and telco security, 
however, Fry Guy was not really dangerous. The Atlanta Three <I>were</I> 
dangerous.  It wasn't the crimes they were committing, but the <I>danger,</I>   
the potential hazard, the sheer <I>technical power</I>  LoD had accumulated, 
that had made the situation untenable. 
<P>	Fry Guy was not LoD.  He'd never laid eyes on anyone in LoD; his 
only contacts with them had been electronic.  Core members of the Legion 
of Doom tended  to meet physically for conventions every year or so, to 
get drunk, give each other the hacker high-sign, send out for pizza and 
ravage hotel suites.  Fry Guy had never done any of this.   Deborah Daniels 
assessed Fry Guy accurately as "an LoD wannabe." 
<P>	Nevertheless Fry Guy's crimes would be directly attributed to LoD 
in much future police propaganda.  LoD would be described as "a closely 
knit group" involved in "numerous illegal activities" including "stealing 
and modifying individual credit histories," and "fraudulently obtaining 
money and property."  Fry Guy did this, but the Atlanta Three didn't; they 
simply weren't into theft, but rather intrusion.   This caused a strange kink 
in the prosecution's strategy.  LoD were accused of "disseminating 
information about attacking computers to other computer hackers in an 
effort to shift the focus of law enforcement to those other hackers and 
away from the Legion of Doom." 
<P>	This last accusation (taken directly from a press release by the 
Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force) sounds particularly far-
fetched.  One might conclude at this point that investigators would have 
been well-advised to go ahead and "shift their focus" from the "Legion of 
Doom."   Maybe they <I>should</I> concentrate on "those other hackers" -- the 
ones who were actually stealing money and physical objects. 
<P>	But the Hacker Crackdown of 1990 was not a simple policing 
action.  It wasn't meant just to walk the beat in  cyberspace -- it was a 
<I>crackdown,</I> a deliberate attempt to nail the core of the operation, to send 
a dire and potent message that would settle the hash of the digital 
underground for good. 
<P>	By this reasoning, Fry Guy wasn't much more than the electronic 
equivalent of a cheap streetcorner dope dealer.  As long as the 
masterminds of LoD were still flagrantly operating, pushing their 
mountains of illicit knowledge right and left, and whipping up enthusiasm 
for blatant lawbreaking, then there would be an <I>infinite supply</I>  of Fry 
Guys. 


<P>	Because LoD were flagrant, they had left trails everywhere, to be 
picked up by law enforcement in New York, Indiana, Florida, Texas, 
Arizona, Missouri, even Australia.  But 1990's war on the Legion of Doom 
was led out of Illinois, by the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task 
Force. 





<P>	The Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, led by federal 
prosecutor William J. Cook, had started in 1987 and had swiftly become 
one of the most aggressive local "dedicated computer-crime units."  
Chicago was a natural home for such a group.  The world's first computer 
bulletin-board system had been invented in Illinois.  The state of Illinois 
had some of the nation's first and sternest computer crime laws.   Illinois 
State Police were markedly alert to the possibilities of white-collar crime 
and electronic fraud. 
<P>	And William J. Cook in particular was a rising star in electronic 
crime-busting.   He and his fellow federal prosecutors at the U.S. 
Attorney's office in Chicago had a tight relation with the Secret Service, 
especially gogetting Chicago-based agent Timothy  Foley.  While Cook 
and his Department of Justice colleagues plotted strategy, Foley was their 
man on the street. 
<P>	Throughout the 1980s, the federal government had given 
prosecutors an armory of new, untried legal tools against computer crime.  
Cook and his colleagues were pioneers in the use of these new statutes in 
the real-life cut-and-thrust of the federal courtroom. 
<P>	On October 2, 1986, the US Senate had passed the "Computer 
Fraud and Abuse Act" unanimously, but there  were pitifully few 
convictions under this statute.  Cook's group took their name from this 
statute, since they were determined to transform this powerful but rather 
theoretical Act of Congress into a real-life engine of legal destruction 
against computer fraudsters and scofflaws. 
<P>	It was not a question of merely discovering crimes, investigating 
them, and then trying and punishing their perpetrators.   The Chicago unit, 
like most everyone else in the business, already <I>knew</I> who the bad guys 
were:  the Legion of Doom and the writers and editors of <I>Phrack.</I> The 
task at hand was to find some legal means of putting these characters 
away. 
<P>	This approach might seem a bit dubious, to someone not 
acquainted with the gritty realities of prosecutorial work.  But prosecutors 
don't put people in jail for crimes they have committed; they put people in 
jail for crimes they have committed <I>that can be proved in court.</I> Chicago 
federal police put Al Capone in prison for income-tax fraud.   Chicago is a 
big town, with a roughand-ready bare-knuckle tradition on both sides of 
the law. 
<P>	Fry Guy had broken the case wide open and alerted telco security 
to the scope of the problem.   But Fry Guy's crimes would not put the 
Atlanta Three behind bars -much less the wacko underground journalists 
of <I>Phrack.</I> So on July 22, 1989, the same day that Fry Guy was raided in 
Indiana, the Secret Service descended upon the Atlanta Three. 
<P>	This was likely inevitable.  By the summer of 1989, law 
enforcement were closing in on the Atlanta Three from at least six 
directions at once.   First, there were the leads from Fry Guy, which had 
led to the DNR registers being installed on the lines of the Atlanta Three.  
The DNR evidence alone would have finished them off, sooner or later. 
But second, the Atlanta lads were already well-known to Control-C and 
his telco security sponsors.  LoD's contacts with telco security had made 
them overconfident and even more boastful than usual; they felt that they 
had powerful friends in high places, and that they were being openly 
tolerated by telco security.  But BellSouth's Intrusion Task Force were hot 
on the trail of LoD and sparing no effort or expense. 
<P>	The Atlanta Three had also been identified by name and listed on 
the extensive anti-hacker files maintained, and retailed for pay, by private 
security operative John Maxfield of Detroit.  Maxfield, who had extensive 
ties to telco security and many informants in the underground,  was a bete 
noire of the <I>Phrack</I> crowd, and the dislike was mutual. 
<P>	The Atlanta Three themselves had written articles for <I>Phrack.</I>  
This boastful act could not possibly escape telco and law enforcement 
attention. 
<P>	"Knightmare," a high-school age hacker from Arizona,  was a close 
friend and disciple of Atlanta LoD, but he had been nabbed by the 
formidable Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Unit.   Knightmare 
was on some of LoD's favorite boards -- "Black Ice" in particular -- and 
was privy to their secrets.  And to have Gail Thackeray, the Assistant 
Attorney General of Arizona, on one's trail was a dreadful peril for any 
hacker. 
<P>	And perhaps worst of all, Prophet had committed a major blunder 
by passing an illicitly copied BellSouth computer-file to Knight Lightning, 
who had published it in <I>Phrack.</I>   This, as we will see, was an act of dire 
consequence for almost everyone concerned. 
<P>	On July 22, 1989, the Secret Service showed up at the  Leftist's 
house, where he lived with his parents.  A massive squad of some twenty 
officers surrounded the building: Secret Service, federal marshals, local 
police, possibly BellSouth telco security; it was hard to tell in the crush. 
Leftist's dad, at work in his basement office, first noticed a muscular 
stranger in plain clothes crashing through the back yard with a drawn 
pistol.   As more strangers poured into the house, Leftist's dad naturally 
assumed there was an armed robbery in progress. 
<P>	Like most hacker parents, Leftist's mom and dad had only the 
vaguest notions of what their son had been up to all this time.   Leftist had 
a day-job repairing computer hardware.  His obsession with computers 
seemed a bit odd, but harmless enough, and likely to produce a wellpaying 
career.  The sudden, overwhelming raid left Leftist's parents traumatized. 
<P>	The Leftist himself had been out after work with his co-workers, 
surrounding a couple of pitchers of margaritas.  As he came trucking on 
tequila-numbed feet up the pavement, toting a bag full of floppy-disks, he 
noticed a large number of unmarked cars parked in his driveway.  All the 
cars sported tiny microwave antennas. 
<P>	The Secret Service had knocked the front door off its hinges, 
almost flattening his Mom. 
<P>	Inside, Leftist was greeted by Special Agent James Cool of the US 
Secret Service, Atlanta office.  Leftist was flabbergasted.  He'd never met a 
Secret Service agent before.   He could not imagine that he'd ever done 
anything worthy of federal attention.  He'd always figured that if his 
activities became intolerable, one of his contacts in telco security would 
give him a private phone-call and tell him to knock it off. 
<P>	But now Leftist was pat-searched for weapons by grim 
professionals, and his bag of floppies was quickly seized. He and his 
parents were all shepherded into separate rooms and grilled at length as a 
score of officers scoured their home for anything electronic. 
<P>	Leftist was horrified as his treasured IBM AT personal computer 
with its forty-meg hard disk, and his recently purchased 80386 IBM-clone 
with a  whopping hundred-meg hard disk, both went swiftly out the door 
in  Secret Service custody.  They also seized all his disks, all his 
notebooks, and a tremendous booty in dogeared telco documents that 
Leftist had snitched out of trash dumpsters. 
<P>	Leftist figured the whole thing for a big misunderstanding.  He'd 
never been into <I>military</I> computers.  He wasn't a <I>spy</I> or a 
<I>Communist.</I>  He  was just a good ol' Georgia hacker, and now he just 
wanted all these people out of the house.  But it seemed they wouldn't go 
until he made some kind of statement. 
<P>	And so, he levelled with them. And that, Leftist said later from his 
federal prison camp in Talladega, Alabama, was a big mistake. 
<P>	The Atlanta area was unique, in that it had three members of the 
Legion of Doom who actually occupied more or less the same physical  
locality.  Unlike the rest of LoD, who tended to associate by phone and 
computer, Atlanta LoD actually <I>were</I> "tightly knit."  It was no real 
surprise that the Secret Service agents apprehending Urvile at the 
computer-labs at Georgia Tech, would discover Prophet with him as well. 
<P>	Urvile, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student in polymer chemistry, 
posed quite a puzzling case for law enforcement.  Urvile --  also known as 
"Necron 99," as well as other handles, for he tended to change his cover-
alias about once a month -- was both an accomplished hacker and a fanatic 
simulation-gamer. 
<P>	Simulation games are an unusual hobby; but then hackers are 
unusual people, and their favorite pastimes tend to be somewhat out of the 
ordinary.  The best-known American simulation game is probably 
"Dungeons &amp; Dragons," a multi-player parlor entertainment played with 
paper, maps, pencils, statistical tables and a variety of oddly-shaped dice.  
Players pretend to be heroic  characters exploring a wholly-invented 
fantasy world.  The fantasy worlds of simulation gaming are commonly 
pseudo-medieval, involving swords and sorcery -- spellcasting wizards, 
knights in armor, unicorns and dragons, demons and goblins. 
<P>	Urvile and his fellow gamers  preferred their fantasies highly 
technological.   They made use of a game known as "G.U.R.P.S.,"  the 
"Generic Universal Role Playing System," published by a company called 
Steve Jackson Games (SJG). 
<P>	"G.U.R.P.S."  served as a framework for creating  a wide variety of 
artificial fantasy worlds.  Steve Jackson Games published  a smorgasboard 
of books, full of detailed information and gaming hints, which were used 
to flesh-out many different fantastic backgrounds for  the basic GURPS 
framework.  Urvile made extensive use of two SJG books called <I>GURPS 
High-Tech</I>  and <I>GURPS Special Ops.</I> 
<P>	In the artificial fantasy-world of <I>GURPS Special  Ops,</I>  players 
entered a modern  fantasy of intrigue and international espionage.   On 
beginning the game, players started small and powerless, perhaps as 
minor-league CIA agents or penny-ante arms dealers.   But as players 
persisted through a series of game sessions (game sessions generally lasted 
for hours, over long, elaborate campaigns that might be pursued for 
months on end) then they would achieve new skills, new knowledge, new 
power.  They would acquire and hone new abilities, such as 
marksmanship, karate, wiretapping, or Watergate burglary.  They could 
also win various kinds of imaginary booty, like Berettas, or martini 
shakers, or fast cars with ejection seats and machine-guns under the 
headlights. As might be imagined from the complexity of these games, 
Urvile's gaming notes were very detailed and extensive.  Urvile was a 
"dungeon-master," inventing scenarios for his fellow gamers, giant 
simulated adventure-puzzles for his friends to unravel.   Urvile's game 
notes covered dozens of pages with all sorts of exotic lunacy, all about 
ninja raids on Libya and break-ins on encrypted Red Chinese 
supercomputers.   His notes were written on scrap-paper and kept in loose-
leaf binders. 
<P>	The handiest scrap paper around Urvile's college digs were the 
many pounds of BellSouth printouts and documents that he had snitched 
out of telco dumpsters. His notes were written on the back of 
misappropriated telco property.   Worse yet, the gaming notes were 
chaotically interspersed with Urvile's hand-scrawled records involving  
<I>actual computer intrusions</I>  that he had committed. 
<P>	Not only was it next to impossible to tell Urvile's fantasy game-
notes from cyberspace "reality," but Urvile  himself barely made this 
distinction.  It's no exaggeration to say that to Urvile it was <I>all</I> a game.   
Urvile was very bright, highly imaginative, and quite careless of other 
people's notions of propriety.  His connection to "reality" was not 
something to which he paid a great deal of attention. Hacking was a game 
for Urvile.  It was an amusement he was carrying out, it was something he 
was doing for fun. And  Urvile was an obsessive young man.  He could no 
more stop hacking than he could stop in the middle of a jigsaw puzzle, or 
stop in the middle of reading a Stephen Donaldson fantasy trilogy.  (The 
name "Urvile" came from a best-selling Donaldson novel.) 
<P>	Urvile's airy, bulletproof attitude seriously annoyed his 
interrogators.   First of all, he didn't consider that he'd done anything 
wrong.  There was scarcely a shred of honest remorse in him.   On the 
contrary, he seemed privately convinced that his police interrogators were 
operating in a demented fantasy-world all their own.  Urvile was too polite 
and well-behaved to say this straightout, but his reactions were askew and 
disquieting. For instance, there was the business about LoD's ability to 
monitor phone-calls to the police and Secret Service.  Urvile agreed that 
this was quite possible, and posed no big problem for LoD.  In fact, he and 
his friends had kicked the idea around on the "Black Ice" board, much as 
they had discussed many other nifty notions,  such as building personal 
flame-throwers and jury-rigging fistfulls of blasting-caps.  They had 
hundreds of dial-up numbers for government agencies that they'd gotten 
through scanning Atlanta phones, or had pulled from raided VAX/VMS 
mainframe computers. 
<P>	Basically, they'd never gotten around to listening in on the cops 
because the idea wasn't interesting enough to bother with.  Besides, if 
they'd been monitoring Secret Service phone calls, obviously they'd never 
have been caught in the first place.  Right? 
<P>	The Secret Service was less than satisfied with this rapier-like 
hacker logic. 
<P>	Then there was the issue of crashing the phone system.  No 
problem, Urvile admitted sunnily.   Atlanta LoD could have shut down 
phone service all over Atlanta any time they liked.   <I>Even the 911 
service?</I>   Nothing  special about that, Urvile explained patiently.   Bring 
the switch to its knees, with say the UNIX "makedir" bug, and 911 goes 
down too as a matter of course.  The 911 system wasn't very interesting, 
frankly.   It might be tremendously interesting to cops (for odd reasons of 
their own), but as technical challenges went, the 911 service was 
yawnsville. So of course the Atlanta Three could crash service. They 
probably could have crashed service all over BellSouth territory, if they'd 
worked at it for a while. But Atlanta LoD weren't crashers.   Only losers 
and rodents were crashers.  LoD were <I>elite.</I> 

<P>	Urvile was privately convinced that sheer technical expertise could 
win him free of any kind of problem.  As far as he was concerned, elite 
status in the digital underground had placed him permanently beyond the  
intellectual grasp of cops and straights.  Urvile had a lot to learn. 
<P>	Of the three LoD stalwarts, Prophet was in the most direct trouble.  
Prophet was a UNIX programming expert who burrowed in and out of the 
Internet as a matter of course.   He'd started his hacking career at around 
age 14, meddling with a UNIX mainframe system at the University of 
North Carolina. 
<P>	Prophet himself had written the handy Legion of Doom file "UNIX 
Use and Security From the Ground Up." UNIX  (pronounced "you-nicks")  
is a powerful, flexible computer operating-system, for multi-user, multi-
tasking computers.   In 1969, when UNIX was created in Bell Labs, such 
computers were exclusive to large corporations and universities, but today 
UNIX is run on thousands of powerful home machines.  UNIX was 
particularly wellsuited to telecommunications programming, and had 
become a standard in the field.   Naturally, UNIX also  became a standard 
for the elite hacker and phone phreak. 
<P>	Lately, Prophet had not been so active as Leftist and Urvile, but 
Prophet was a recidivist.   In 1986, when he was eighteen, Prophet had 
been convicted of "unauthorized access to a computer network" in North 
Carolina.  He'd been discovered breaking into the Southern Bell Data 
Network, a UNIX-based internal telco network supposedly closed to the 
public.  He'd gotten a typical hacker sentence:  six months suspended, 120 
hours community service, and three years' probation. 
<P>	After that humiliating bust, Prophet had gotten rid of most of his 
tonnage of illicit phreak and hacker data, and had tried to go straight.  He 
was, after all, still on probation. But by  the autumn of 1988, the 
temptations of cyberspace had proved too much for young Prophet, and he 
was shoulder-to-shoulder with Urvile and Leftist into some of the hairiest 
systems around. 
<P>	In early September 1988, he'd broken into BellSouth's centralized 
automation system, AIMSX or "Advanced Information Management 
System."     AIMSX was an internal business network for BellSouth, 
where telco employees stored electronic mail, databases, memos, and 
calendars, and did text processing.   Since AIMSX did not have public 
dial-ups, it was considered utterly invisible to the public, and was not well-
secured -- it didn't even require passwords.   Prophet abused an account 
known as "waa1," the personal account of an unsuspecting telco employee.   
Disguised as the owner of waa1, Prophet made about ten visits to AIMSX. 
<P>	Prophet did not damage or delete anything in the system.  His 
presence in AIMSX was harmless and almost invisible.  But he could not 
rest content with that. 
<P>	One particular piece of processed text on AIMSX was a telco 
document known as "Bell South Standard Practice 660-225-104SV 
Control Office Administration of Enhanced 911 Services for Special 
Services and Major Account Centers dated March 1988." 
<P>	Prophet had not been looking for this document.  It was merely one 
among hundreds of similar documents  with impenetrable titles.  However, 
having blundered over it in the course of his illicit wanderings through 
AIMSX, he decided to take it with him as a trophy.  It might prove very 
useful in some future boasting, bragging, and strutting session.   So,  some 
time in September 1988, Prophet ordered the AIMSX mainframe computer 
to copy this document (henceforth called simply  called "the E911 
Document")  and  to transfer this copy to his home computer. 
<P>	No one noticed that Prophet had done this.  He had "stolen" the 
E911 Document in some sense, but notions of property in cyberspace can 
be tricky.   BellSouth noticed nothing wrong, because BellSouth still had 
their original copy.  They had not been "robbed" of the document itself. 
Many people were supposed to copy this document -specifically, people 
who worked for the nineteen BellSouth "special services and major 
account centers," scattered throughout the Southeastern United States.  
That was what it was for, why it was present on a computer network in the 
first place: so that it could be copied and read -by telco employees.   But 
now the data had been copied by someone who wasn't supposed to look at 
it. 
<P>	Prophet now had his trophy.  But he further decided to store yet 
another copy of the E911 Document on another person's computer.  This 
unwitting person was a computer enthusiast named Richard Andrews who 
lived near Joliet, Illinois.  Richard Andrews was a UNIX programmer by 
trade, and ran a powerful UNIX board called "Jolnet," in the basement of 
his house. 
<P>	Prophet, using the handle "Robert Johnson," had obtained an 
account on Richard Andrews' computer.  And  there he stashed the E911 
Document, by storing it in his own private section of Andrews' computer. 
<P>	Why did Prophet do this?  If Prophet had eliminated the E911 
Document from his own computer, and kept it hundreds of miles away, on 
another machine, under an alias, then he might have been fairly safe from 
discovery and prosecution -- although his sneaky action had certainly put 
the unsuspecting Richard Andrews at risk. 
<P>	But, like most hackers, Prophet was a pack-rat for  illicit data.  
When it came to the crunch, he could not bear to part from his trophy.   
When Prophet's place in Decatur, Georgia was raided in July 1989, there 
was the E911 Document, a smoking gun.  And there was Prophet in the 
hands of the Secret Service, doing his best to "explain." 
<P>	Our story now takes us away from the Atlanta Three and their raids 
of the Summer of 1989.  We must leave Atlanta Three "cooperating fully" 
with their numerous investigators.  And  all three of them did cooperate, as 
their  Sentencing Memorandum from the US District Court of the 
Northern Division of Georgia explained  -just before all three of them 
were sentenced to various federal prisons in November 1990. 
<P>	We must now catch up on the other aspects of the war on the 
Legion of Doom.   The war on the Legion was a  war on a network -- in 
fact, a network of three networks, which intertwined and interrelated in a 
complex fashion. The Legion itself, with Atlanta LoD, and their hanger-on 
Fry Guy, were the first network.  The second network was <I>Phrack</I> 
magazine, with its editors and contributors. The third  network involved 
the electronic circle around a  hacker known as "Terminus." 
<P>	The war against these hacker networks was carried out by a law 
enforcement network.  Atlanta LoD  and Fry Guy were pursued by USSS 
agents and federal prosecutors in Atlanta, Indiana, and Chicago.  
"Terminus" found himself pursued by USSS and  federal prosecutors from 
Baltimore and Chicago.  And the war against Phrack was almost entirely a 
Chicago operation. 
<P>	The investigation of Terminus involved a great deal of energy, 
mostly from the Chicago Task Force, but it was to be the least-known and 
least-publicized of the Crackdown operations.  Terminus, who lived in 
Maryland, was a UNIX programmer and consultant, fairly wellknown 
(under his given name)  in the UNIX community, as an acknowledged 
expert on AT&amp;T minicomputers. Terminus idolized AT&amp;T, especially 
Bellcore, and longed for public recognition as a UNIX expert; his highest 
ambition was to work for Bell Labs. 
<P>	But Terminus had odd friends and a spotted history. Terminus had 
once been  the subject of an admiring interview in <I>Phrack</I> (Volume II, 
Issue 14, Phile 2  -dated May 1987).   In this article, <I>Phrack</I> co-editor 
Taran King described "Terminus" as an electronics engineer,  5'9", brown-
haired, born in 1959 -- at 28 years old, quite mature for a hacker. 
<P>	Terminus had once been sysop of a phreak/hack underground 
board called "MetroNet," which ran on an Apple II.  Later he'd replaced 
"MetroNet" with an underground board called "MegaNet," specializing in 
IBMs.  In his younger days, Terminus had written one of the very first and 
most elegant code-scanning programs for the IBM-PC.  This program had 
been widely distributed in the underground.  Uncounted legions of PC-
owning  phreaks and hackers had used Terminus's scanner  program to rip-
off telco codes.  This  feat had not escaped the attention of telco security; it 
hardly could, since Terminus's earlier handle, "Terminal Technician," was 
proudly written right on the program. 
<P>	When he became a full-time computer professional (specializing in 
telecommunications programming),  he adopted the handle Terminus, 
meant to indicate that he had "reached the final point of being a proficient 
hacker." He'd moved up to the UNIX-based "Netsys" board on an AT&amp;T 
computer, with four phone lines and an impressive 240 megs of storage.   
"Netsys" carried complete issues of <I>Phrack,</I> and Terminus was quite 
friendly with its publishers, Taran King and Knight Lightning. 
<P>	In the early 1980s, Terminus had been a regular on Plovernet, 
Pirate-80, Sherwood Forest and Shadowland, all well-known pirate 
boards, all heavily frequented by the Legion of Doom.   As it happened, 
Terminus was never officially "in LoD," because he'd never been given the 
official LoD high-sign and back-slap by Legion maven Lex Luthor.   
Terminus had never physically met anyone from LoD.  But that scarcely 
mattered much -- the Atlanta Three themselves had never been officially 
vetted by Lex, either. As far as law enforcement was concerned, the issues 
were clear. Terminus was a full-time, adult computer professional with 
particular skills at AT&amp;T software and hardware -- but Terminus reeked of 
the Legion of Doom and the underground. 
<P>	On February 1, 1990 -- half a month after the Martin Luther King 
Day Crash --  USSS  agents Tim Foley from Chicago, and Jack Lewis 
from the Baltimore office, accompanied by AT&amp;T security officer Jerry 
Dalton, travelled to Middle Town, Maryland.  There they grilled Terminus 
in his home (to the stark terror of his wife and small children), and, in their 
customary fashion, hauled his computers out the door. 
<P>	The Netsys machine proved to contain a plethora of arcane UNIX 
software -- proprietary source code formally owned by AT&amp;T.  Software 
such as:  UNIX System Five Release 3.2; UNIX SV Release 3.1;  UUCP 
communications software; KORN SHELL; RFS; IWB; WWB; DWB; the 
C++ programming language; PMON; TOOL CHEST; QUEST; DACT, 
and S FIND. 
<P>	In the long-established piratical tradition of the underground,  
Terminus had been trading this illicitlycopied  software with a small circle 
of fellow UNIX programmers.   Very unwisely, he had stored seven years 
of his electronic mail on his Netsys machine, which documented all the 
friendly arrangements he had made with his various colleagues. Terminus 
had not crashed the AT&amp;T phone system on January 15.  He was, 
however, blithely running a notfor-profit AT&amp;T software-piracy ring.  
This was not an  activity AT&amp;T found amusing.   AT&amp;T security officer 
Jerry Dalton valued this "stolen" property at over three hundred thousand 
dollars. 
<P>	AT&amp;T's entry into the tussle of free enterprise had been 
complicated by the new, vague groundrules of the information economy.   
Until the break-up of Ma Bell, AT&amp;T was forbidden to sell computer 
hardware or software.  Ma Bell was the phone company; Ma Bell was not 
allowed to use the enormous revenue from telephone utilities, in order to 
finance any entry into the computer market. 
<P>	AT&amp;T nevertheless invented the UNIX operating system.   And 
somehow AT&amp;T managed to make UNIX a minor source of income.  
Weirdly, UNIX was not sold as computer software, but actually retailed 
under an obscure regulatory exemption allowing sales of surplus 
equipment and scrap.  Any bolder attempt to promote or retail UNIX 
would have aroused angry legal opposition from computer companies.  
Instead, UNIX was licensed to universities, at modest rates, where the 
acids of academic freedom ate away steadily at AT&amp;T's proprietary rights. 
<P>	Come the breakup, AT&amp;T recognized that UNIX was a potential 
gold-mine.   By now, large chunks of UNIX code had been created that 
were not AT&amp;T's, and were being sold by others.  An entire rival UNIX-
based operating system had arisen in Berkeley, California  (one of the 
world's great founts of ideological hackerdom). Today, "hackers" 
commonly consider "Berkeley UNIX" to be technically superior to 
AT&amp;T's "System V UNIX," but AT&amp;T has not allowed mere technical 
elegance to intrude on the real-world business of marketing proprietary 
software.   AT&amp;T has made its own code deliberately incompatible with 
other folks' UNIX, and has written code that it can prove is copyrightable, 
even if that code happens to be somewhat awkward -- "kludgey."   AT&amp;T 
UNIX user licenses are serious business agreements, replete with very 
clear copyright statements and nondisclosure clauses. 
<P>	AT&amp;T has not exactly kept the UNIX cat in the bag,  but it kept a 
grip on its scruff with some success.   By the rampant, explosive standards 
of software piracy, AT&amp;T UNIX source code is heavily copyrighted, well-
guarded, well-licensed.   UNIX was traditionally run only on mainframe 
machines, owned by large groups of suit-andtie professionals, rather than 
on bedroom machines where people can get up to easy mischief.


<P>	And AT&amp;T UNIX source code is serious high-level programming.   
The number of skilled UNIX programmers with any actual motive to 
swipe UNIX  source code is small.  It's tiny, compared to the tens of 
thousands prepared to rip-off, say, entertaining PC games like "Leisure 
Suit Larry." 
<P>	But by 1989, the warez-d00d underground, in the persons of 
Terminus and his friends,  was gnawing at AT&amp;T UNIX.  And the 
property in question was not sold for twenty bucks over the counter at the 
local branch of Babbage's or Egghead's;  this was massive, sophisticated, 
multi-line, multi-author corporate code worth tens of thousands of dollars. 
<P>	It must be recognized at this point that Terminus's purported ring 
of UNIX software pirates had not actually made any money from their 
suspected crimes.  The $300,000 dollar figure bandied about for the 
contents of Terminus's computer did not mean that Terminus was in actual 
illicit possession of three hundred thousand of AT&amp;T's  dollars.   Terminus 
was shipping software back  and forth, privately, person to person, for free.  
He was not making a commercial business of piracy.  He hadn't asked for 
money; he didn't take money.  He lived quite modestly. 
<P>	AT&amp;T employees -- as well as freelance UNIX consultants, like 
Terminus -- commonly worked with "proprietary" AT&amp;T software, both in 
the office and at home on their private machines.   AT&amp;T rarely sent 
security officers out to comb the hard disks of its consultants.   Cheap 
freelance UNIX  contractors were quite useful to AT&amp;T; they didn't have 
health insurance or retirement programs, much less union membership in 
the Communication Workers of America.  They were humble digital 
drudges, wandering with mop and bucket through the Great Technological 
Temple of AT&amp;T; but when the Secret Service arrived at their homes, it 
seemed they were eating with company silverware and sleeping on 
company sheets!  Outrageously, they behaved as if the things they worked 
with every day belonged to them! 
<P>	And these were no mere hacker teenagers with their hands full of 
trash-paper and their noses pressed to the corporate windowpane.  These 
guys were UNIX wizards, not only carrying AT&amp;T data in their machines 
and their heads, but eagerly networking about it, over machines that were 
far more powerful than anything previously imagined in private hands.  
How do you keep people disposable, yet assure their awestruck respect for 
your property?  It was a dilemma. 

<P>	Much UNIX code was public-domain, available for free.   Much 
"proprietary" UNIX code had been extensively re-written, perhaps altered 
so much that it became an entirely new product -- or perhaps not.  
Intellectual property rights for software developers were, and are, 
extraordinarily complex and confused.   And software "piracy," like the 
private copying of videos, is one of the most widely practiced "crimes" in 
the world today. The USSS were not experts in UNIX or familiar with the 
customs of its use.   The United States Secret Service, considered as a 
body, did not have one single person in it who could program in a UNIX 
environment -- no, not even one.   The Secret Service <I>were</I> making 
extensive use of expert help, but the "experts" they had chosen were 
AT&amp;T and Bellcore security officials, the very victims of the purported 
crimes under investigation, the very people whose interest in AT&amp;T's  
"proprietary" software was most pronounced. 
<P>	On February 6, 1990, Terminus was arrested by Agent Lewis.  
Eventually, Terminus would be sent to prison for his illicit use of a piece 
of AT&amp;T software. 
<P>	The issue of pirated AT&amp;T software would bubble along in the 
background during the war on the Legion of Doom.  Some half-dozen of 
Terminus's on-line acquaintances, including people in Illinois, Texas and  
California, were grilled by the Secret Service in connection with the illicit 
copying of software.   Except for Terminus, however, none were charged 
with a crime.  None of them shared his peculiar prominence in the hacker 
underground. 
<P>	But that did not meant that these people would, or could, stay out 
of trouble.   The transferral of illicit data in cyberspace is hazy and ill-
defined business, with paradoxical dangers for everyone concerned:  
hackers, signal carriers, board owners,  cops, prosecutors, even random 
passers-by.  Sometimes, well-meant attempts to avert trouble  or punish 
wrongdoing bring more trouble than  would simple ignorance, indifference 
or impropriety. 
<P>	Terminus's "Netsys" board was not a common-or- garden bulletin 
board system, though it had most of the usual functions of a board.  Netsys 
was not a stand-alone machine, but part of the globe-spanning  "UUCP" 
cooperative network.  The UUCP network uses a set of Unix software 
programs called "Unix-to-Unix Copy," which allows Unix systems to 
throw data to one another at high speed through the public telephone 
network.   UUCP is a radically decentralized, not-for-profit network of 
UNIX computers.   There are tens of thousands of these UNIX machines.  
Some are small, but many are powerful and  also link to other networks.  
UUCP has certain arcane links to  major networks such as JANET, 
EasyNet, BITNET, JUNET, VNET, DASnet, PeaceNet and FidoNet, as 
well as the gigantic Internet.  (The so-called "Internet" is not actually a 
network itself, but rather an "internetwork" connections standard that 
allows several globe-spanning computer networks to communicate with 
one another. Readers fascinated by the weird and intricate tangles of 
modern computer networks may enjoy John S. Quarterman's authoritative 
719-page explication, <I>The Matrix,</I> Digital Press, 1990.) 
<P>	A skilled user of Terminus' UNIX machine could send and receive 
electronic mail from almost any major  computer network in the world.  
Netsys was not called a "board" per se, but rather a "node."   "Nodes" were 
larger, faster, and more sophisticated than mere "boards," and for hackers, 
to hang out on internationally-connected "nodes" was quite the step up 
from merely hanging out on local "boards." Terminus's Netsys node in 
Maryland had a number of direct links to other, similar UUCP  nodes, run 
by people who shared his interests and at least something of  his free-
wheeling attitude.   One of these nodes was Jolnet, owned by Richard 
Andrews, who, like Terminus, was an independent UNIX consultant.   
Jolnet also ran UNIX, and could be contacted at high speed by mainframe 
machines from all over the world.  Jolnet was quite a sophisticated piece 
of work, technically speaking, but it was still run by an individual, as a 
private, not-for-profit hobby.   Jolnet was mostly used by other UNIX 
programmers -- for mail, storage, and access to networks.  Jolnet supplied 
access network access to about two hundred people, as well as a local 
junior college. Among its various features and services, Jolnet also carried 
<I>Phrack</I> magazine. 
<P>	For reasons of his own, Richard Andrews had become  suspicious 
of a new user called  "Robert Johnson."  Richard Andrews took it upon 
himself to have a look at what "Robert Johnson" was storing in Jolnet.  
And Andrews found the E911 Document. 
<P>	"Robert Johnson" was the Prophet from the Legion of Doom, and 
the E911 Document was illicitly copied data from Prophet's raid on the 
BellSouth computers. 
<P>	The E911 Document, a particularly illicit piece of digital property, 
was about to resume its long, complex, and disastrous career. 
<P>	It struck Andrews as fishy that someone not a telephone employee 
should have a document referring to the "Enhanced 911 System."  Besides,  
the document itself bore an obvious warning. 
<P>	"WARNING:  NOT FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE OUTSIDE 
BELLSOUTH OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES EXCEPT UNDER 
WRITTEN AGREEMENT." 
<P>	These standard nondisclosure tags are often appended to all sorts of 
corporate material.   Telcos as a species are particularly notorious for 
stamping most everything in sight as "not for use or disclosure."  Still, this 
particular piece of data was  about the 911 System.  That sounded bad to  
Rich Andrews. 
<P>	Andrews was not prepared to ignore this sort of trouble.  He 
thought it would be wise to pass the document along to a friend and 
acquaintance on the UNIX network, for consultation.  So, around 
September 1988, Andrews sent yet another copy of the E911 Document 
electronically to an AT&amp;T employee, one Charles Boykin, who ran a 
UNIX-based node called "attctc" in Dallas, Texas. 
<P>	"Attctc" was the property of AT&amp;T, and was run from AT&amp;T's 
Customer Technology Center  in Dallas, hence the  name "attctc."  
"Attctc" was better-known as "Killer," the name of the machine that the 
system was running on. "Killer" was a hefty, powerful, AT&amp;T 3B2 500 
model, a multi-user, multi-tasking UNIX platform with 32 meg of memory 
and a mind-boggling 3.2 Gigabytes of storage.  When  Killer had first 
arrived in Texas, in 1985, the 3B2 had been one of AT&amp;T's great white 
hopes for going head- to-head with IBM for the corporate computer-
hardware market.  "Killer" had been shipped to the Customer Technology 
Center in the Dallas Infomart, essentially a high-technology mall, and 
there it sat, a demonstration model. 
<P>	Charles Boykin, a veteran AT&amp;T hardware and digital 
communications expert, was a local technical backup man for the AT&amp;T 
3B2 system.   As a display model in the Infomart mall, "Killer" had little 
to do, and it seemed a shame to waste the system's capacity.  So Boykin 
ingeniously wrote some UNIX bulletin-board software for "Killer," and 
plugged the machine in to the local phone network.   "Killer's" debut in 
late 1985 made it the first  publicly available UNIX site in the state of 
Texas.  Anyone who wanted to play was welcome. 
<P>	The machine immediately attracted an electronic community.  It 
joined the UUCP network, and offered network links to over eighty other 
computer sites, all of which became dependent on Killer for their links to 
the greater world of cyberspace.   And it wasn't just for the big guys; 
personal computer users also stored freeware programs for the Amiga, the 
Apple, the IBM and the Macintosh on Killer's vast 3,200 meg archives.  At 
one time, Killer had the largest library of public-domain Macintosh 
software in Texas. 
<P>	Eventually, Killer attracted about 1,500 users, all busily 
communicating, uploading and downloading, getting mail, gossipping, and 
linking to arcane and distant networks. 

<P>	Boykin received no pay for running Killer.  He considered it good 
publicity for the AT&amp;T 3B2 system (whose sales were somewhat less than 
stellar), but he also simply enjoyed the vibrant community his skill had 
created.   He gave away the bulletin-board UNIX software he had written, 
free of charge. 
<P>	In the UNIX programming community, Charlie Boykin had the 
reputation of a warm, open-hearted, levelheaded kind of guy.   In 1989, a 
group of Texan UNIX professionals voted Boykin "System Administrator 
of the Year."   He was considered a fellow you could trust for good advice. 
<P>	In September 1988, without warning, the E911 Document came 
plunging into Boykin's life, forwarded by Richard Andrews.  Boykin 
immediately recognized that the Document was hot property.   He was not 
a voicecommunications man, and knew little about the ins and  outs of the 
Baby Bells, but he certainly knew what the 911 System was, and he was 
angry to see confidential data about it in the hands of a nogoodnik.  This 
was clearly a matter for telco security.  So, on September 21, 1988, Boykin 
made yet <I>another</I> copy of the  E911 Document and passed this one 
along to a professional acquaintance of his, one Jerome Dalton, from 
AT&amp;T Corporate Information Security.   Jerry Dalton was the very fellow 
who would later raid Terminus's house. From AT&amp;T's security division, 
the E911 Document went to Bellcore. Bellcore (or BELL 
COmmunications REsearch)  had once been the central laboratory of the 
Bell System.  Bell Labs employees had invented the UNIX operating 
system.  Now Bellcore was a quasi-independent, jointly owned company 
that  acted as the research arm for all seven of the Baby Bell RBOCs.   
Bellcore was in a good position to co-ordinate security technology and 
consultation for the RBOCs, and the gentleman in charge  of this effort 
was Henry M. Kluepfel, a veteran of the Bell System who had worked 
there for twenty-four years. 
<P>	On October  13, 1988, Dalton passed the E911 Document to Henry 
Kluepfel.  Kluepfel, a veteran expert witness in telecommunications fraud 
and computer-fraud cases, had certainly seen worse trouble than this.   He 
recognized the document for what it was:  a trophy from a hacker break-in. 
<P>	However, whatever harm had been done in the intrusion was 
presumably old news.   At this point there  seemed little to be done.  
Kluepfel made a careful note of the circumstances and shelved the 
problem for the time being. 
<P>	Whole months passed. 
<P>	February 1989 arrived.  The Atlanta Three were living it up in Bell 
South's switches, and had not yet met their comeuppance.   The Legion 
was thriving.  So was <I>Phrack</I> magazine.   A good six months had passed 
since Prophet's AIMSX break-in.  Prophet, as hackers will, grew weary of 
sitting on his laurels.  "Knight Lightning" and "Taran King,"  the editors of 
<I>Phrack,</I> were always begging Prophet for material they could publish.   
Prophet decided that the heat must be off by this time, and that he could 
safely brag, boast, and strut. 
<P>	So he sent a copy of the E911 Document -- yet another one -- from 
Rich Andrews' Jolnet machine to Knight Lightning's  BITnet account at 
the University of Missouri. Let's review the fate of the document so far. 
<P>	0.  The original E911 Document.  This in the AIMSX system on a 
mainframe computer in Atlanta, available to hundreds of people, but all of 
them, presumably, BellSouth employees.   An unknown number of them 
may have their own copies of this document, but they are all professionals 
and all trusted by the phone company. 
<P>	1.  Prophet's illicit copy, at home on his own computer in Decatur, 
Georgia. 
<P>	2.  Prophet's back-up copy, stored on Rich Andrew's Jolnet 
machine in the basement of Rich Andrews'  house near Joliet Illinois. 
<P>	3.  Charles Boykin's copy on "Killer" in Dallas, Texas, sent by Rich 
Andrews from Joliet. 
<P>	4.  Jerry Dalton's copy at AT&amp;T Corporate Information Security in 
New Jersey, sent from Charles Boykin in Dallas. 
<P>	5.  Henry Kluepfel's copy at Bellcore security headquarters in New 
Jersey, sent by Dalton. 
<P>	6.  Knight Lightning's copy, sent by Prophet from Rich Andrews' 
machine, and now in Columbia, Missouri. 

<P>	We can see that the "security" situation of this proprietary 
document, once dug out of AIMSX,  swiftly became bizarre.   Without any 
money changing hands, without any particular special effort, this data had 
been  reproduced at least six times and had spread itself all over the 
continent.  By far the worst, however, was yet to come. 
<P>	In February 1989, Prophet and Knight Lightning bargained 
electronically over the fate of this trophy. Prophet wanted to boast, but, at 
the same time, scarcely wanted to be caught. 
<P>	For his part, Knight Lightning was eager to publish as much of the 
document as he could manage.   Knight Lightning was a fledgling 
political-science major with a particular interest in freedom-of-information 
issues.  He would gladly publish most anything that would reflect glory on 
the prowess of the underground and embarrass the telcos.   However, 
Knight Lightning himself had contacts in telco security, and sometimes 
consulted them on material he'd received that might be too dicey for 
publication. 
<P>	Prophet and  Knight Lightning decided to edit the E911 Document 
so as  to delete most of its identifying traits.   First of all, its large "NOT 
FOR USE OR DISCLOSURE" warning had to go.  Then there were other 
matters.  For instance, it listed the office telephone  numbers of several 
BellSouth 911 specialists in Florida.  If these phone numbers were 
published in <I>Phrack,</I> the BellSouth employees involved would very 
likely be hassled by phone phreaks, which would anger BellSouth no end, 
and pose a definite operational hazard for both Prophet and <I>Phrack.</I> 
<P>	So Knight Lightning cut the Document almost in half, removing 
the phone numbers and some of the touchier and more specific 
information.  He passed it back electronically to Prophet;  Prophet was still 
nervous, so Knight Lightning cut a bit more.  They finally agreed that it 
was ready to go, and that it would be published in <I>Phrack</I> under the 
pseudonym, "The Eavesdropper." 
<P>	And this was done on February 25, 1989. 
<P>	The twenty-fourth issue of <I>Phrack</I>  featured a chatty interview 
with co-ed phone-phreak "Chanda Leir," three articles on BITNET and its 
links to other computer networks,  an article on 800 and 900 numbers by 
"Unknown User,"  "VaxCat's" article on telco basics (slyly entitled 
"Lifting Ma Bell's Veil of Secrecy,)" and the usual "Phrack World News." 
<P>	The News section, with painful irony, featured an extended account 
of the sentencing of "Shadowhawk,"  an eighteen-year-old Chicago hacker 
who had just been put in federal prison by William J. Cook himself. 
<P>	And then there were the two articles by "The Eavesdropper."   The 
first was the  edited E911 Document, now titled "Control Office 
Administration Of Enhanced 911 Services for Special Services and Major 
Account Centers."  Eavesdropper's second article was a glossary of terms 
explaining the blizzard of telco acronyms and buzzwords in the E911 
Document. 
<P>	The hapless document was now distributed, in the usual <I>Phrack</I> 
routine, to a good one hundred and fifty sites.  Not a hundred and fifty 
<I>people,</I> mind you -- a hundred and fifty <I>sites,</I> some of these sites 
linked to UNIX nodes or bulletin board systems, which themselves had 
readerships of tens, dozens, even hundreds of people. 
<P>	This was February 1989.  Nothing happened immediately.  
Summer came, and the Atlanta crew were raided by the Secret Service.   
Fry Guy was apprehended. Still nothing whatever happened to <I>Phrack.</I> 
Six more issues of <I>Phrack</I> came out, 30 in all, more or less on a monthly 
schedule.  Knight Lightning and co-editor Taran King went untouched. 
<P>	<I>Phrack</I> tended to duck and cover whenever the heat came down.  
During the summer busts of 1987 -(hacker busts tended to cluster in 
summer, perhaps because hackers were easier to find at home than in 
college) -- <I>Phrack</I> had ceased publication for several months, and laid 
low.   Several LoD hangers-on had been arrested, but nothing had 
happened to the <I>Phrack</I>  crew, the premiere gossips of the underground.  
In 1988, <I>Phrack</I> had been taken over by a new editor, "Crimson  Death," 
a raucous youngster with a taste for anarchy files. 

<P>	1989, however, looked like a bounty year for the underground.  
Knight Lightning and his co-editor Taran King took up the reins again, and 
<I>Phrack</I> flourished throughout 1989.   Atlanta LoD went down hard in 
the summer of 1989, but <I>Phrack</I> rolled merrily on.   Prophet's E911 
Document seemed unlikely to cause <I>Phrack</I> any trouble.  By January 
1990, it had been available in <I>Phrack</I> for almost a year.   Kluepfel and 
Dalton, officers of Bellcore and AT&amp;T  security, had possessed the 
document for sixteen months -- in fact, they'd had it even before Knight 
Lightning himself, and had done nothing in particular to stop its 
distribution.  They hadn't even told Rich Andrews or Charles Boykin to 
erase the copies from their UNIX nodes, Jolnet and Killer. But then came 
the monster Martin Luther King Day Crash of January 15, 1990. 
<P>	A flat three days later, on January 18,  four agents showed up at 
Knight Lightning's fraternity house.   One was Timothy Foley, the second 
Barbara Golden, both of  them Secret Service agents from the Chicago 
office.   Also along was a University of Missouri security officer, and 
Reed Newlin, a security man from Southwestern Bell, the RBOC having 
jurisdiction over Missouri. Foley accused Knight Lightning of causing the 
nationwide crash of the phone system. 
<P>	Knight Lightning was aghast at this allegation.   On  the face of it, 
the suspicion was not entirely implausible - though Knight Lightning knew 
that he himself hadn't done it.   Plenty of hot-dog hackers had bragged that 
they could crash the phone system, however.  "Shadowhawk," for instance, 
the Chicago hacker whom William Cook had recently put in jail, had 
several times  boasted on boards that he could "shut down AT&amp;T's public 
switched network." And now this event, or something that looked just like 
it, had actually taken place.  The Crash had lit a fire under the Chicago 
Task Force.  And the former fencesitters at Bellcore and AT&amp;T were now 
ready to roll.  The consensus among telco security -- already horrified by 
the skill of the BellSouth intruders  -- was that the digital underground was 
out of hand.  LoD and <I>Phrack</I> must go. 
<P>	And in publishing Prophet's E911 Document, <I>Phrack</I> had 
provided law enforcement with what appeared to be a powerful legal 
weapon. Foley confronted Knight Lightning about the  E911 Document. 
<P>	Knight Lightning was cowed.  He immediately began "cooperating 
fully" in the usual tradition of the digital underground. 
<P>	He gave Foley a complete run of <I>Phrack,</I>printed out in a set of 
three-ring binders.   He handed over his electronic mailing list of <I>Phrack</I> 
subscribers. Knight Lightning was grilled for four hours by Foley and his 
cohorts.  Knight Lightning admitted that Prophet had passed him the E911 
Document, and he admitted that he had known it was stolen booty from a 
hacker raid on a telephone company.  Knight Lightning signed a statement  
to this effect, and agreed, in writing, to cooperate with investigators. 
<P>	Next day -- January 19, 1990, a Friday  -- the Secret Service 
returned with a search warrant, and thoroughly searched Knight 
Lightning's upstairs room in the  fraternity house.   They took all his floppy 
disks, though, interestingly, they left Knight Lightning in possession of 
both his computer and his modem.  (The computer had no hard disk, and 
in Foley's judgement was not a store of evidence.)   But this was a very 
minor bright spot among Knight Lightning's rapidly multiplying troubles.  
By this time, Knight Lightning was in plenty of hot water, not only with 
federal police, prosecutors, telco investigators, and university security, but 
with the elders of his own campus fraternity, who were outraged to think 
that they had been unwittingly harboring a federal computer-criminal. 
<P>	On Monday, Knight Lightning was summoned to Chicago, where 
he was further grilled by Foley and USSS veteran agent Barbara Golden, 
this time with an attorney present.  And on Tuesday, he was formally 
indicted by a federal grand jury. 
<P>	The trial of Knight Lightning, which occurred on July 24-27, 1990, 
was the crucial show-trial of the Hacker Crackdown.  We will examine the 
trial at some length in Part Four of this book. In the meantime, we must 
continue our dogged pursuit of the E911 Document. 
<P>	It must have been clear by January 1990 that the E911 Document, 
in the form <I>Phrack</I> had published it back in February 1989, had gone off 
at the speed of light in at least a hundred and fifty different directions.   To 
attempt to put this electronic genie back in the bottle was flatly impossible. 
<P>	And yet, the E911 Document was <I>still</I> stolen property, formally 
and legally speaking.  Any electronic transference of this document, by 
anyone unauthorized to have it, could be interpreted as an act of wire 
fraud.  Interstate transfer of stolen property, including electronic property, 
was a federal crime. 
<P>	The Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force had been 
assured that the E911 Document was worth a hefty sum of money.  In fact, 
they had a precise estimate of its worth from BellSouth security personnel:  
$79,449. A sum of this scale seemed to warrant vigorous prosecution.  
Even if the damage could not be undone, at least this large sum offered a 
good legal pretext for stern punishment of the thieves.   It seemed likely to 
impress judges and juries. And it could be used in court to mop up the 
Legion of Doom. 
<P>	The Atlanta crowd was already in the bag, by the time the Chicago 
Task Force had gotten around to <I>Phrack.</I> But the Legion was a hydra-
headed thing.   In late 89, a brand-new Legion of Doom board, "Phoenix 
Project," had gone up in Austin, Texas.  Phoenix Project was sysoped by 
no less a man than the Mentor himself, ably assisted by University of 
Texas student and hardened Doomster "Erik Bloodaxe." As we have seen 
from his <I>Phrack</I> manifesto, the Mentor was a hacker zealot who 
regarded computer intrusion as something close to a moral duty.  Phoenix 
Project  was an ambitious effort, intended to revive the digital 
underground to what Mentor considered the full flower of the early 80s.  
The Phoenix board would also boldly bring elite hackers face-to-face with 
the telco "opposition."  On "Phoenix," America's cleverest hackers would 
supposedly shame the telco squareheads out of their stick-in-the-mud 
attitudes, and perhaps convince  them that the Legion of Doom elite were 
really an all-right crew.  The  premiere of "Phoenix Project" was heavily 
trumpeted by <I>Phrack,</I> and "Phoenix Project" carried a complete run of 
<I>Phrack</I> issues, including the E911 Document as <I>Phrack</I> had published 
it. 
<P>	Phoenix Project was only one of many -- possibly hundreds -- of 
nodes and boards all over America that were in guilty possession of the 
E911 Document.  But Phoenix was an outright, unashamed Legion of 
Doom board.  Under Mentor's guidance, it was flaunting itself in the face 
of telco security personnel. Worse yet, it was actively trying to <I>win them 
over</I> as sympathizers for the digital underground elite.   "Phoenix" had no 
cards or codes on it.  Its hacker elite considered Phoenix at least  
technically legal.   But Phoenix was a corrupting influence, where hacker 
anarchy was eating away like digital acid at the underbelly of corporate 
propriety. The Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force now 
prepared to descend upon Austin, Texas. 
<P>	Oddly, not one but <I>two</I> trails of the Task Force's investigation 
led toward Austin.  The city of Austin, like Atlanta, had made itself a 
bulwark of the Sunbelt's Information Age, with a strong university 
research presence, and a number of cutting-edge electronics companies, 
including Motorola, Dell, CompuAdd, IBM, Sematech and MCC. 
<P>	Where computing machinery went, hackers generally followed.  
Austin boasted not only "Phoenix Project," currently LoD's most flagrant 
underground board, but a number of UNIX  nodes. 
<P>	One of these nodes was "Elephant," run by a UNIX consultant 
named Robert Izenberg.  Izenberg, in search of  a relaxed Southern 
lifestyle and a lowered cost-of-living, had recently migrated to Austin 
from New Jersey.  In New Jersey, Izenberg had worked for an independent 
contracting company, programming UNIX code for AT&amp;T itself.  
"Terminus" had been a frequent user on Izenberg's privately owned 
Elephant node. 
<P>	Having interviewed Terminus and examined the records on Netsys, 
the Chicago Task Force were now convinced that they had discovered an 
underground gang of UNIX software pirates, who were demonstrably 
guilty of interstate trafficking in illicitly copied  AT&amp;T source code. 
Izenberg was swept into the dragnet around Terminus, the self-proclaimed 
ultimate UNIX hacker. 
<P>	Izenberg, in Austin, had settled down into a UNIX job with a 
Texan branch of IBM.  Izenberg was no longer working as a contractor for 
AT&amp;T, but he had friends in New Jersey, and he still logged on to AT&amp;T 
UNIX computers back in New Jersey, more or less whenever it pleased 
him.  Izenberg's activities appeared highly suspicious to the Task Force.  
Izenberg might well be breaking into AT&amp;T computers, swiping AT&amp;T 
software, and passing it to  Terminus and other possible confederates, 
through the UNIX node network.  And this data was worth, not merely 
$79,499, but hundreds of thousands of dollars! 
<P>	On February 21, 1990, Robert Izenberg arrived home from work at 
IBM to find that all the computers had mysteriously vanished from his 
Austin apartment. Naturally he assumed that he had been robbed.  His 
"Elephant" node, his other machines, his notebooks, his disks, his tapes, 
all gone!  However, nothing much else seemed disturbed -- the place had 
not been ransacked. The puzzle becaming much stranger some five 
minutes later.   Austin U. S. Secret Service Agent Al Soliz, accompanied 
by University of Texas campus-security officer Larry Coutorie and the 
ubiquitous Tim Foley, made their appearance at Izenberg's door.  They 
were in plain clothes: slacks, polo shirts.  They came in, and Tim Foley 
accused Izenberg of belonging to the Legion of Doom. 
<P>	Izenberg told them that he had never heard of the "Legion of 
Doom."  And what about a certain stolen E911 Document, that posed a 
direct threat to the police emergency lines?   Izenberg claimed that he'd 
never heard of that, either. 
<P>	His interrogators found this difficult to believe. Didn't he know 
Terminus? 
<P>	Who? 
<P>	They gave him Terminus's real name.  Oh yes, said Izenberg.  He 
knew <I>that</I> guy all right -- he was leading discussions on the Internet 
about AT&amp;T computers, especially the AT&amp;T 3B2. 
<P>	AT&amp;T had thrust this machine into the marketplace, but, like many 
of AT&amp;T's ambitious attempts to enter the computing arena, the 3B2 
project had something less than a glittering success.   Izenberg himself had 
been a  contractor for the division of AT&amp;T that supported the 3B2. The 
entire division had been shut down. Nowadays, the cheapest and quickest 
way to get help with this fractious piece of machinery was to join one of 
Terminus's discussion groups on the Internet, where friendly and 
knowledgeable hackers would help you for free.

<P>	Naturally the remarks within this group were less than flattering 
about the Death Star....  was <I>that</I> the problem? 
<P>	Foley told Izenberg that Terminus had been acquiring hot software 
through his, Izenberg's, machine. 
<P>	Izenberg shrugged this off.   A good eight megabytes of data 
flowed through his UUCP site every day.   UUCP nodes spewed data like 
fire hoses.  Elephant had been directly linked to Netsys -- not surprising, 
since Terminus was a 3B2 expert and Izenberg had been a 3B2 contractor. 
Izenberg was also linked to "attctc" and the University of Texas.   
Terminus was a well-known UNIX expert, and might have been up to all 
manner of hijinks on Elephant. Nothing Izenberg could do about that.  
That was physically impossible.  Needle in a haystack. 

<P>	In a four-hour grilling, Foley urged Izenberg to come clean and 
admit that he was in conspiracy with Terminus, and a member of the 
Legion of Doom. Izenberg denied this.  He was no weirdo teenage hacker -
- he was thirty-two years old, and didn't even have a "handle."  Izenberg 
was a former TV technician and electronics specialist who had drifted into 
UNIX consulting as a full-grown adult.   Izenberg had never met 
Terminus, physically.  He'd once bought a cheap highspeed modem from 
him, though. 
<P>	Foley told him that this modem (a Telenet T2500 which ran at 19.2 
kilobaud, and which had just gone out  Izenberg's door in Secret Service 
custody)  was likely hot property.  Izenberg was taken aback to hear this; 
but then again, most of Izenberg's equipment, like that of most freelance 
professionals in the industry, was discounted, passed hand-to-hand through 
various kinds of barter and gray-market.   There was no proof that the 
modem was stolen, and even if it was, Izenberg hardly saw how that gave 
them the right to take every electronic item in his house. 

<P>	Still, if the United States Secret Service figured they needed his 
computer for national security reasons -- or whatever -- then Izenberg 
would not kick.  He figured he would somehow make the sacrifice of his 
twenty thousand dollars' worth of professional equipment, in the spirit of 
full cooperation and good citizenship. 
<P>	Robert Izenberg was not arrested.  Izenberg was not charged with 
any crime.  His UUCP node -- full of some 140 megabytes of the files, 
mail, and data of himself and his dozen or so entirely innocent users --  
went out the door as "evidence."  Along with the disks and tapes, Izenberg 
had lost about 800 megabytes of data. 
<P>	Six months would pass before Izenberg decided to phone the 
Secret Service and ask how the case was going. That was the first time that 
Robert Izenberg would ever hear the name of William Cook.  As of 
January 1992, a full two years after the seizure, Izenberg, still not charged 
with any crime, would be struggling through the morass of the courts, in 
hope of recovering his thousands of dollars' worth of seized equipment. 
<P>	In the meantime, the Izenberg case received absolutely no press 
coverage.   The Secret Service had walked into an Austin home, removed a 
UNIX bulletinboard system, and met with no operational difficulties 
whatsoever. 
<P>	Except that word of a crackdown had percolated through the 
Legion of Doom.   "The Mentor" voluntarily shut down "The Phoenix 
Project."  It seemed a pity,  especially as telco security employees had, in 
fact, shown up on Phoenix, just as he had hoped -- along with the usual 
motley crowd of LoD heavies, hangers-on, phreaks, hackers and 
wannabes.  There was "Sandy" Sandquist from US SPRINT security, and 
some guy named Henry Kluepfel, from Bellcore itself!  Kluepfel had been 
trading friendly banter with hackers on Phoenix since January 30th (two 
weeks after the Martin Luther King Day Crash). The presence of such a 
stellar telco official seemed quite the coup for Phoenix Project. 
<P>	Still, Mentor could judge the climate.  Atlanta in ruins, <I>Phrack</I> in 
deep trouble, something weird going on with UNIX nodes -- discretion 
was advisable.  Phoenix Project went off-line. 
<P>	Kluepfel, of course, had been monitoring this LoD bulletin board 
for his own purposes -- and those of the Chicago unit.   As far back as June 
1987, Kluepfel had logged on to a Texas underground board called 
"Phreak Klass 2600."  There he'd discovered an Chicago youngster named 
"Shadowhawk," strutting and boasting about rifling AT&amp;T computer files, 
and bragging of his ambitions to riddle AT&amp;T's Bellcore computers with 
trojan horse programs.  Kluepfel had passed the news to Cook in Chicago, 
Shadowhawk's computers had gone out the door in Secret Service custody, 
and Shadowhawk himself had gone to jail. 
<P>	Now it was Phoenix Project's turn.   Phoenix Project postured 
about "legality" and "merely intellectual interest," but it reeked of the 
underground.  It had <I>Phrack</I> on it.  It had the E911 Document.  It had a 
lot of dicey talk about breaking into systems, including some bold and 
reckless stuff about a supposed "decryption service" that Mentor and 
friends were planning to run, to help crack encrypted passwords off of 
hacked systems. 
<P>	Mentor was an adult.   There was a  bulletin board at his place of 
work, as well.  Kleupfel logged onto this board, too, and discovered it to 
be called "Illuminati."  It was run by some company called Steve Jackson 
Games. On  March 1, 1990, the Austin crackdown went into high gear. 
<P>	On the morning of March 1 -- a Thursday -- 21-yearold University 
of Texas student "Erik Bloodaxe," co-sysop of Phoenix Project and an 
avowed member of the Legion of Doom, was wakened by a police 
revolver levelled at his head. 
<P>	Bloodaxe watched, jittery, as Secret Service agents appropriated 
his 300 baud terminal and, rifling his files, discovered his treasured 
source-code for Robert Morris's notorious Internet Worm.  But Bloodaxe, 
a wily operator, had suspected that something of the like might be coming.  
All his best equipment had been hidden away elsewhere.  The raiders took 
everything electronic, however, including his telephone.  They were 
stymied by his hefty arcade-style Pac-Man game, and left it in place, as it 
was simply too heavy to move. 
<P>	Bloodaxe was not arrested.   He was not charged with any crime.  
A good two years later, the police still had what they had taken from him, 
however. 
<P>	The Mentor was less wary.  The dawn raid rousted him and his 
wife from bed in their underwear, and six Secret Service agents, 
accompanied by an Austin policeman and  Henry Kluepfel himself, made a 
rich haul. Off went the works, into the agents' white Chevrolet minivan:  
an IBM PC-AT clone with 4 meg of RAM and a  120-meg hard disk; a 
Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II printer; a completely legitimate and highly 
expensive SCO-Xenix 286 operating system; Pagemaker disks and 
documentation; and the Microsoft Word word-processing program.  
Mentor's wife had her incomplete academic  thesis stored on the hard-disk; 
that went, too, and so did the couple's telephone.  As of two years later, all 
this property remained in police custody. 
<P>	Mentor remained under guard in his apartment as agents prepared 
to raid Steve Jackson Games.  The fact that this was a business 
headquarters and not a private residence did not deter the agents.  It was 
still very early; no one was at work yet.  The agents prepared to break 
down the door, but Mentor, eavesdropping on the Secret  Service walkie-
talkie traffic, begged them not to do it, and offered his key to the building. 
<P>	The exact details of the next events are unclear.  The agents would 
not let anyone else into the building.  Their search warrant, when 
produced, was unsigned. Apparently they breakfasted from the local 
"Whataburger," as the litter from hamburgers was later found inside.  They 
also extensively sampled a bag of jellybeans kept by an SJG employee.  
Someone tore a "Dukakis for President" sticker from the wall. 
<P>	SJG employees, diligently showing up for the day's  work, were 
met at the door and briefly questioned by U.S. Secret Service agents.  The 
employees watched in astonishment as agents wielding crowbars and 
screwdrivers emerged with captive machines.  They attacked outdoor 
storage units with boltcutters.  The agents wore blue nylon windbreakers 
with "SECRET SERVICE" stencilled across the back, with running-shoes 
and jeans. 
<P>	Jackson's company lost three computers, several hard-disks, 
hundred of floppy disks, two monitors, three modems, a laser printer, 
various powercords, cables, and adapters (and, oddly, a small bag of 
screws, bolts and  nuts).   The seizure of Illuminati BBS deprived SJG of 
all the programs, text files, and private e-mail on the board. The loss of 
two other SJG computers was a severe blow as well, since it caused the 
loss of electronically stored contracts, financial projections, address 
directories, mailing lists, personnel files, business correspondence, and, 
not least, the drafts of forthcoming games and gaming books. 
<P>	No one at Steve Jackson Games was arrested.  No one was accused 
of any crime.   No charges were filed. Everything appropriated was 
officially kept as "evidence" of crimes never specified. 
<P>	After the <I>Phrack</I> show-trial, the Steve Jackson Games scandal 
was the most bizarre and aggravating incident of the Hacker Crackdown of 
1990.   This raid by the Chicago Task Force on a science-fiction gaming 
publisher was to rouse a swarming host of civil liberties issues, and gave 
rise to an enduring controversy that was still re-complicating itself, and 
growing in the scope of its implications, a full two years later. 
<P>	The pursuit of the E911 Document stopped with the Steve Jackson 
Games raid.   As we have seen, there were hundreds, perhaps thousands of 
computer users in America with the E911 Document in their possession.  
Theoretically, Chicago had a perfect legal right to raid any of these people, 
and could have legally seized the machines of anybody who subscribed to 
<I>Phrack.</I> However, there was no copy of the E911 Document on 
Jackson's Illuminati board.   And there the Chicago raiders stopped dead; 
they have not raided anyone since. It might be assumed that Rich Andrews 
and Charlie Boykin, who had brought the E911 Document to the attention 
of telco security, might be spared any official suspicion.  But as we have 
seen, the willingness to  "cooperate fully" offers little, if any, assurance 
against federal anti-hacker prosecution. 
<P>	Richard Andrews found himself in deep trouble, thanks to the 
E911 Document.  Andrews lived in Illinois, the native stomping grounds 
of the Chicago Task Force. On February 3 and 6, both his home and his 
place of work were raided by USSS.  His machines went out the door, too, 
and he was grilled at length (though not arrested). Andrews proved to be in 
purportedly guilty possession of: UNIX SVR 3.2; UNIX SVR 3.1; UUCP; 
PMON; WWB; IWB; DWB; NROFF; KORN SHELL '88; C++; and 
QUEST, among other items.   Andrews had received this proprietary code 
-- which AT&amp;T officially valued at well over $250,000 -- through the 
UNIX network, much of it supplied to him as a personal favor by 
Terminus.  Perhaps worse yet, Andrews admitted to returning the favor, by 
passing Terminus a copy of AT&amp;T proprietary STARLAN source code. 

<P>	Even Charles Boykin, himself an AT&amp;T employee, entered some 
very hot water.   By 1990, he'd almost forgotten about the E911 problem 
he'd reported in September 88; in fact, since that date, he'd passed two 
more security alerts to Jerry Dalton, concerning matters that Boykin 
considered far worse than the E911 Document. 
<P>	But by 1990, year of the crackdown,  AT&amp;T Corporate Information 
Security was fed up with "Killer."   This machine offered no  direct 
income to AT&amp;T, and was providing aid and comfort to a cloud of 
suspicious yokels from outside the company, some of them actively 
malicious toward AT&amp;T, its property, and its corporate interests.   
Whatever goodwill and publicity had been won among Killer's 1,500 
devoted users was considered no longer worth the security risk.  On 
February 20, 1990, Jerry Dalton arrived in Dallas and simply unplugged 
the phone jacks, to the puzzled alarm of Killer's many Texan users. Killer 
went permanently off-line, with the loss of vast archives of programs and 
huge quantities of electronic mail; it was never restored to service.   AT&amp;T 
showed no  particular regard for the "property" of these 1,500 people. 
Whatever "property" the users had been storing on AT&amp;T's computer 
simply vanished completely. 
<P>	Boykin, who had himself reported the E911 problem, now found 
himself under a cloud of suspicion.  In a weird private-security replay of 
the Secret Service seizures, Boykin's own home was visited by AT&amp;T 
Security and his own machines were carried out the door. 
<P>	However, there were marked special features in the Boykin case.   
Boykin's disks and his personal computers were swiftly examined by his 
corporate employers and  returned politely in just two days -- (unlike 
Secret Service seizures, which commonly take months or years).   Boykin 
was not charged with any crime or wrongdoing, and he kept his job with 
AT&amp;T (though he did retire from AT&amp;T in September 1991, at the age of 
52). 
<P>	It's interesting to note that the US Secret Service somehow failed to 
seize Boykin's "Killer" node and carry AT&amp;T's own computer out the 
door.   Nor did they raid Boykin's home.  They seemed perfectly willing to 
take the word of AT&amp;T Security that AT&amp;T's employee, and AT&amp;T's 
"Killer" node, were free of hacker contraband and on the up-and-up. 
<P>	It's digital water-under-the-bridge at this point, as Killer's 3,200 
megabytes of Texan electronic community  were erased in 1990, and 
"Killer" itself was shipped out of the state. 
<P>	But the experiences of Andrews and Boykin, and the users of their 
systems, remained side issues.   They did not begin to assume the social, 
political, and legal importance that gathered, slowly but inexorably, around 
the issue of the raid on Steve Jackson Games. 

<P>	We must now turn our attention to Steve Jackson Games itself, 
and explain what SJG was, what it really did, and how it had managed to 
attract this particularly odd and virulent kind of trouble.  The reader may 
recall that this is not the first but the second time that the company has 
appeared in this narrative; a Steve Jackson game called GURPS was a 
favorite pastime of Atlanta hacker Urvile, and Urvile's science-fictional 
gaming notes had been mixed up promiscuously with notes about his 
actual computer intrusions. 
<P>	First, Steve Jackson Games, Inc., was <I>not</I> a publisher of 
"computer games."  SJG published "simulation games," parlor games that 
were played on paper, with pencils, and dice, and printed guidebooks full 
of rules and statistics tables.  There were no computers involved in the 
games themselves.   When you bought a Steve Jackson Game, you did not 
receive any software disks.  What you got was a plastic bag with some 
cardboard game tokens, maybe a few maps or a deck of cards.  Most of 
their products were books. 
<P>	However, computers <I>were</I> deeply involved in the Steve Jackson 
Games business.  Like almost all modern publishers, Steve Jackson and 
his fifteen employees used computers to write text, to keep accounts, and 
to run the business generally.  They also used a computer to run their 
official bulletin board system for Steve Jackson Games, a board called 
Illuminati.  On Illuminati, simulation gamers who happened to own 
computers and modems could associate, trade mail, debate the theory and 
practice of gaming, and keep up with the company's news and its product 
announcements. 
<P>	Illuminati was a modestly popular board, run on a  small computer 
with limited storage,  only one phone-line, and no ties to large-scale 
computer networks.   It did, however, have hundreds of users, many of 
them dedicated gamers willing to call from out-of-state. 
<P>	Illuminati was <I>not</I> an "underground" board.  It did not feature 
hints on computer intrusion, or "anarchy files," or illicitly posted credit 
card numbers, or long-distance access codes.  Some of Illuminati's users, 
however, were members of the Legion of Doom.    And so was one of 
Steve Jackson's senior employees -- the Mentor.   The Mentor wrote for 
<I>Phrack,</I> and also ran an underground board, Phoenix Project -- but the 
Mentor was not a computer professional.  The Mentor was the managing 
editor of Steve Jackson Games and a professional game designer by trade.   
These LoD members did not use  Illuminati to help their <I>hacking</I> 
activities.  They used it to help their <I>game-playing</I> activities -- and they 
were even more dedicated to simulation gaming than they were to hacking. 
<P>	"Illuminati" got its name from a card-game that Steve Jackson 
himself, the company's founder and sole owner, had invented.  This multi-
player card-game was one of Mr Jackson's best-known, most successful, 
most technically innovative products.   "Illuminati" was a game of 
paranoiac conspiracy in which various antisocial cults warred covertly to 
dominate the world.   "Illuminati" was  hilarious, and great fun to play, 
involving flying saucers, the CIA, the KGB, the phone companies, the Ku 
Klux Klan, the South American Nazis, the cocaine cartels, the Boy Scouts, 
and dozens of other splinter groups from the twisted depths of Mr. 
Jackson's professionally fervid imagination.  For the uninitiated, any 
public discussion of the "Illuminati" card-game sounded, by turns, utterly 
menacing or completely insane. 
<P>	And then there was SJG's "Car Wars," in which souped-up 
armored hot-rods with rocket-launchers and heavy machine-guns did battle 
on the American highways of the future.   The lively Car Wars discussion 
on the Illuminati board featured many meticulous, painstaking discussions 
of the effects of grenades, land-mines, flamethrowers and napalm.  It 
sounded like hacker anarchy files run amuck. 
<P>	Mr Jackson and his co-workers earned their daily bread by 
supplying people with make-believe adventures and weird ideas.  The 
more far-out, the better. 
<P>	Simulation gaming is an unusual pastime, but gamers have not 
generally had to beg the permission of the Secret Service to exist.  
Wargames and role-playing adventures are an old and honored pastime, 
much  favored by professional military strategists.   Once littleknown, 
these games are now played by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts 
throughout North America, Europe and Japan.  Gaming-books, once 
restricted to hobby outlets, now commonly appear in chain-stores like B. 
Dalton's and Waldenbooks, and sell vigorously. 
<P>	Steve Jackson Games, Inc., of Austin, Texas, was a games 
company of the middle rank.  In 1989, SJG grossed about a million 
dollars.   Jackson himself had a good reputation in his industry as a 
talented and innovative designer of rather unconventional games, but his 
company was something less than a titan of the field -certainly not like the 
multimillion-dollar TSR Inc., or Britain's gigantic "Games Workshop." 
<P>	SJG's Austin headquarters was a modest two-story  brick office-
suite, cluttered with phones, photocopiers, fax machines and computers. It 
bustled with semi-organized activity and was littered with glossy 
promotional brochures and dog-eared science-fiction novels.  Attached to 
the offices was a large tin-roofed warehouse piled twenty feet high with 
cardboard boxes of games and books.   Despite the weird imaginings that 
went on within it, the SJG  headquarters was quite a quotidian, everyday 
sort of place. It looked like what it was:  a publishers' digs. Both "Car 
Wars" and "Illuminati" were well-known, popular games.  But the 
mainstay of the Jackson organization was their Generic Universal Role-
Playing System, "G.U.R.P.S."   The GURPS system was considered solid 
and well-designed, an asset for players.  But perhaps the most popular 
feature of the GURPS system was that it allowed gaming-masters to 
design scenarios that closely resembled well-known books, movies, and 
other works of fantasy.  Jackson had  licensed and adapted works from 
many science fiction and fantasy authors.  There was <I>GURPS Conan,</I> 
<I>GURPS Riverworld,</I> <I>GURPS Horseclans,</I> <I>GURPS Witch World,</I>  
names eminently  familiar to science-fiction readers.  And there was 
<I>GURPS Special Ops,</I>  from the world of espionage fantasy and 
unconventional warfare. 
<P>	And then there was <I>GURPS Cyberpunk.</I> 
<P>	"Cyberpunk" was a term given to certain science fiction writers 
who had entered the genre in the 1980s. "Cyberpunk," as the label implies, 
had two general distinguishing features.  First, its writers had a compelling 
interest in information technology, an interest closely akin to science 
fiction's earlier fascination with space travel. And second, these writers  
were "punks," with all the distinguishing features that that implies:  
Bohemian artiness, youth run wild, an air of deliberate rebellion, funny 
clothes and hair, odd politics, a fondness for abrasive rock and roll; in a 
word, trouble. 
<P>	The "cyberpunk" SF writers were a small group of mostly college-
educated white middle-class litterateurs, scattered through the US and 
Canada.  Only one, Rudy Rucker, a professor of computer science in 
Silicon Valley, could rank with even the humblest computer hacker.   But, 
except for Professor Rucker, the "cyberpunk" authors were not 
programmers or hardware experts; they considered themselves artists (as, 
indeed, did Professor Rucker). However, these writers all owned 
computers, and took an intense and public interest in the social 
ramifications of the information industry. 
<P>	The cyberpunks had a strong following among the global 
generation that had grown up in a world of computers, multinational 
networks, and  cable television. Their outlook was considered somewhat 
morbid, cynical, and dark, but then again, so was the outlook of their 
generational peers.  As that generation matured and increased in strength 
and influence, so did the cyberpunks.   As science-fiction writers went, 
they were  doing fairly well for themselves.  By the late 1980s, their work 
had attracted attention from gaming companies, including Steve Jackson 
Games, which was planning a cyberpunk simulation for the flourishing 
GURPS gamingsystem. 
<P>	The time seemed ripe for such a product, which had already been 
proven in the marketplace.  The first gamescompany out of the gate, with a 
product boldly called "Cyberpunk" in defiance of possible infringement-
ofcopyright suits, had been an upstart group called R. Talsorian.  
Talsorian's Cyberpunk was a fairly decent game, but the mechanics of the 
simulation system left a lot to be desired.  Commercially, however, the 
game did very well. 
<P>	The next cyberpunk game had been the even more successful 
<I>Shadowrun</I> by FASA Corporation.  The mechanics of this game were 
fine, but the scenario was rendered moronic by  sappy fantasy elements 
like elves,  trolls, wizards, and  dragons -- all highly ideologically- 
incorrect, according to the hard-edged, high-tech standards of cyberpunk 
science fiction. 
<P>	Other game designers were champing at the bit. Prominent among 
them was the Mentor, a gentleman  who, like most of his friends in the 
Legion of Doom, was quite the cyberpunk devotee.  Mentor reasoned that 
the time had come for a <I>real</I> cyberpunk gaming-book -- one that the 
princes of computer-mischief in the Legion of Doom could play without 
laughing themselves sick.  This book, <I>GURPS Cyberpunk,</I>  would reek 
of culturally online authenticity. 

<P>	Mentor was particularly well-qualified for this task. Naturally, he 
knew far more about computer-intrusion and digital skullduggery than any 
previously published cyberpunk author.  Not only that, but he was good at 
his work.   A vivid imagination, combined with an instinctive feeling for 
the working of systems and, especially, the loopholes within them, are 
excellent qualities for a professional game designer. 
<P>	By March 1st, <I>GURPS Cyberpunk</I> was almost complete, ready 
to print and ship.  Steve Jackson expected vigorous sales for this item, 
which, he hoped, would keep the company financially afloat for several 
months. <I>GURPS Cyberpunk,</I>  like the other GURPS "modules," was not 
a "game" like a Monopoly set, but a <I>book:</I>  a bound paperback book the 
size of a glossy magazine, with  a slick color cover, and pages full of text, 
illustrations, tables and footnotes.   It was advertised as a game, and was 
used as an aid to game-playing,  but it was a book, with an ISBN number, 
published in Texas, copyrighted, and sold in bookstores. And now, that 
book, stored on a computer, had gone out the door in the custody of the 
Secret Service. 
<P>	The day after the raid, Steve Jackson visited the local Secret 
Service headquarters with a lawyer in tow.  There he confronted Tim Foley 
(still in Austin at that time) and demanded his book back.   But there was 
trouble. <I>GURPS Cyberpunk,</I>  alleged a Secret Service agent to 
astonished businessman Steve Jackson, was "a manual for computer 
crime." 
<P>	"It's science fiction," Jackson said. 
<P>	"No, this is real."  This statement was repeated several times, by 
several agents.  Jackson's ominously accurate game had passed from pure, 
obscure, smallscale fantasy into the impure, highly publicized, largescale 
fantasy of the Hacker Crackdown. No mention was made of the real reason 
for the search.  According to their search warrant, the raiders had expected 
to find the E911 Document stored on Jackson's bulletin board system.   
But that warrant was sealed; a procedure that most law enforcement 
agencies will use  only when lives are demonstrably in danger.   The 
raiders' true motives were not discovered until the Jackson searchwarrant 
was unsealed by his lawyers, many months later. The Secret Service, and 
the Chicago Computer Fraud and Abuse Task Force, said absolutely 
nothing to Steve Jackson about any threat to the police 911 System.   They 
said nothing about the Atlanta Three, nothing about <I>Phrack</I> or Knight 
Lightning, nothing about Terminus. 
<P>	Jackson was left to believe that his computers had been seized 
because he intended to publish a science fiction book that law enforcement 
considered too dangerous to see print. 
<P>	This misconception was repeated again and again, for months, to 
an ever-widening public audience.  It was  not the truth of the case; but as 
months passed, and this misconception was publicly printed again and 
again, it became one of the few publicly known "facts" about the 
mysterious Hacker Crackdown.   The Secret Service had seized a 
computer to stop the publication of a cyberpunk science fiction book. 
<P>	The second section of this book, "The Digital Underground," is 
almost finished now.  We have become acquainted with all the major 
figures of this case who actually belong to the underground milieu of 
computer intrusion.   We have some idea of their history, their motives, 
their general modus operandi.  We now know, I hope, who they are, where 
they came from, and more or  less what they want.  In the next section of 
this book, "Law and Order," we will leave this milieu and directly enter 
the world of America's computer-crime police. At this point, however, I 
have another figure to introduce:  myself. 
<P>	My name is Bruce Sterling.   I live in Austin, Texas, where I am a 
science fiction writer by trade:  specifically, a <I>cyberpunk</I> science fiction 
writer. 
<P>	Like my "cyberpunk" colleagues in the U.S. and Canada, I've never 
been entirely happy with this literary label -- especially after it became a 
synonym for computer criminal.  But I did once edit a book of stories by 
my colleagues, called  <I>MIRRORSHADES:  the Cyberpunk Anthology,</I>  
and I've long been a writer of literarycritical cyberpunk manifestos.   I am 
not a "hacker" of any description, though I do have readers in the digital 
underground. 
<P>	When the Steve Jackson Games seizure occurred, I naturally took 
an intense interest.  If "cyberpunk" books were being banned by federal 
police in my own home town, I reasonably wondered whether I myself 
might be next.  Would my computer be seized by the Secret  Service?  At 
the time, I was in possession of an aging Apple IIe without so much as a 
hard disk.  If I were to be raided as an author of computer-crime manuals, 
the loss of my feeble word-processor would likely provoke more snickers 
than sympathy. 
<P>	I'd known Steve Jackson for many years.   We knew one another as 
colleagues, for we frequented the same local science-fiction conventions.  
I'd played Jackson games, and recognized his cleverness; but he certainly 
had never struck me as a potential mastermind of computer crime. 
<P>	I also knew a little about computer bulletin-board  systems.  In the 
mid-1980s I had taken an active role in an Austin board called "SMOF-
BBS," one of the first boards dedicated to science fiction.  I had a modem, 
and on occasion I'd logged on to Illuminati, which always looked 
entertainly wacky, but certainly harmless enough. 
<P>	At the time of the Jackson seizure, I had no experience whatsoever 
with underground boards.   But I knew that no one on Illuminati talked 
about breaking into systems illegally, or about robbing phone companies. 
Illuminati didn't even offer pirated computer games. Steve Jackson, like 
many creative artists,  was markedly touchy about theft of intellectual 
property. 
<P>	It seemed to me that Jackson was either seriously suspected of 
some crime -- in which case, he would be  charged soon, and would have 
his day in court -- or else he was innocent, in which case the Secret 
Service would quickly return his equipment, and everyone would have a 
good laugh.  I rather expected the good laugh.  The situation was not 
without its comic side.  The raid, known as the "Cyberpunk Bust" in the 
science fiction community,  was winning a great deal of free national 
publicity both for Jackson himself and the "cyberpunk" science fiction 
writers generally. 
<P>	Besides, science fiction people are used to being misinterpreted.  
Science fiction is a colorful, disreputable, slipshod occupation, full of 
unlikely oddballs, which, of course, is why we like it.   Weirdness can be 
an occupational hazard in our field.  People who wear Halloween 
costumes are sometimes mistaken for monsters. 
<P>	Once upon a time -- back in 1939, in New York City -science 
fiction and the U.S. Secret Service collided in a comic case of mistaken 
identity.  This weird incident involved a literary group quite famous in 
science fiction, known as "the Futurians," whose membership included 
such future genre greats as Isaac Asimov, Frederik Pohl, and Damon 
Knight.  The Futurians were every bit as offbeat and wacky as any of their 
spiritual descendants, including the cyberpunks, and were given to 
communal living, spontaneous group renditions of light opera, and 
midnight fencing exhibitions on the lawn.  The Futurians didn't have 
bulletin board systems, but they did have the technological equivalent in 
1939 -- mimeographs and a private printing press.   These were in steady 
use, producing a stream of science-fiction fan magazines,  literary 
manifestos, and weird articles, which were picked up in ink-sticky bundles 
by a succession of strange, gangly, spotty young men in fedoras and 
overcoats. 
<P>	The neighbors grew alarmed at the antics of the Futurians and 
reported them to the Secret Service as suspected counterfeiters.   In the 
winter of 1939, a squad of USSS agents with drawn guns burst into 
"Futurian House," prepared to confiscate the forged currency and illicit 
printing presses.  There they discovered a slumbering science fiction fan 
named George Hahn, a guest of the Futurian commune who had just 
arrived in New York. George Hahn managed to explain himself and his 
group, and the Secret Service agents left the Futurians in peace henceforth.  
(Alas, Hahn died in 1991, just before I had discovered this astonishing 
historical parallel, and just before I could interview him for this book.) 
<P>	But the Jackson case did not come to a swift and comic end.   No 
quick answers came his way, or mine;  no  swift reassurances that all was 
right in the digital world, that matters were well in hand after all.   Quite 
the opposite.   In my alternate role as a sometime pop-science journalist, I 
interviewed  Jackson and his staff for an article in a British magazine.   
The strange details of the raid left me more concerned than ever.   Without 
its computers, the company had been financially and operationally 
crippled.   Half the SJG workforce, a group of entirely innocent people, 
had been sorrowfully fired, deprived of their livelihoods by the seizure.  It 
began to dawn on me that authors -- American writers -- might well have 
their computers seized, under sealed warrants, without any criminal 
charge; and that, as Steve Jackson had discovered, there was no immediate 
recourse for this. This was no joke; this wasn't science fiction; this was 
real. 
<P>	I determined to put science fiction aside until I had discovered 
what had happened and where this trouble had come from.  It was time to 
enter the purportedly real world of electronic free expression and computer 
crime. Hence, this book.  Hence, the world of the telcos;  and the world of 
the digital underground; and next, the world of the police.
